		"Review": "Ah, what a beautiful picture.I love this book. The attraction comes, I think, partly from the beauty of the subject, but also partly from the clean way in which Strang packages all of his mathematical expositions. I spent many a nerdy weekend morning with this book and the OCW lectures.Which brings me to the second most important point that I'd like to get across in this review: you need to pair this book with MIT OpenCourseWare's Linear Algebra lectures (also, coincidentally, taught by the magnificent Strang). They're all freely available on the OCW site or on YouTube. These follow the book very closely and are indispensable\u2014Strang is an even better lecturer than he is a writer. (Some friends complain of a certain \"Strang-speak\" in his book: a certain awkwardness with words that sometimes obscures a point. I can understand these gripes, and this is why the lectures are really absolutely necessary until one has adjusted to the writing style.)The most important point, of course, is that I think you should read this book. Linear algebra (as portrayed by this book) is a really beautiful field\u2014much cleaner and often more intuitive than other areas at the same level (calculus, differential equations, etc.). It will activate a new part of your mind, and give you new ways to visualize problems in other domains [1]. This book reminded me of the value of math, when other textbooks and other classes sometimes failed to do so. Give this book a try\u2014it will change your mind!Footnotes:1. As a programmer, this book has opened up new opportunities for me. I can now talk fluently about the machinery behind least-squares problems, neural networks, etc., and I can now explore more advanced parts of machine learning, data mining, computational statistics, etc. etc. Absolutely worth it!"

		"Review": "Strang has a unique way to represent linear algebra, it is confusing at first but you if you start connecting with the book you would absolutely love it. Is you want to learn the concepts of this books totally, you have to learn calculus and basic trigonometry first. Linear algebra is one of the most beautiful and useful subjects in mathematics. I enjoyed reading this book very much"

		"Review": "I read this in conjunction with MIT's OCW Scholar class and did all the problem sets and took the tests. Took me some time to finish the course, but it was surprising to find how fun linear algebra can be. I mean matrices and vectors? They weren't nearly sexy as curvy double integrals (multivariable calculus) or kinky Markov chains (probability theory). And I took the course only because linear algebra was indispensable for making a headway into mathematical statistics, probability theory, and other higher branches of math. But I have to admit, I kind of started liking this dowdy branch of math for its plain elegance. You have to admit, it's SO plain. Just look at the cover. Squares and rectangles? Are we in elementary geometry here? Euclid is, like, so played out. BUT there's some sexiness here if you look closely: Gaussian elimination, projections, eigenvalues and eigenvectors, diagonalization, and the crux of it all, single value decomposition (yes, I know, I'm shamelessly showing off a little here because I genuinely think these are cool-sounding and actually practical concepts). True to their reputation, Professor Strang's video lectures are golden\u2014there was one with a bad camera and another that was hard to follow, but that's like 2 out of 33 lectures. The rest were crystal clear and made the subject sound a bit too easy. The book, on the other hand, was less clear and less useful, as it keeps bringing up new concepts ahead of time and doesn't give motivating explanations for the material (I'm still a little iffy on why diagonalization is useful, how the \"particular\" solution is related to \"special\" solutions in solving Ax = b, or how single value decomposition can be applied, for example). The biggest problem with this book is, well, the problem sets. They are really not all that helpful. He should have at least included questions from other sections (for greater learning) and more basic questions just to let the students practice the mechanics of the concepts. They were also just...disappointingly easy. Compared to, say, Blitzstein's excellent but difficult probability theory online class, the questions were either trivially abstract or too basic to be of any challenge to contribute to solid learning experience. Overall, though, I would definitely recommend this textbook along with his lectures, but I'd complement it with a more rigorous textbook and/or online course (which I'm planning on doing with Sheldon Axler's Linear Algebra Done Right and Paul Halmos's Linear Algebra Problem Book). I did get a good grasp of the field (though far from mastery) and it was well worth the effort. "

However, if you tend to prefer a more 'traditional' mathematical writing style then you may find the structuring of this book uncomfortable.The first two-thirds (or so) of the book are covered by MIT 18.06SC and the clean layout of each topic along with exercises and solutions may be easier for a learner new to this subject."

		"Review": "I skimmed through the book for the review of linear algebra. I am not satisfied with the exposition - it's \"messy\". Author obviously tried to make the thematic as close as possible to the novices, but in the process he created a style that will not satisfy someone more adjusted to usual mathematical flow of exposition. Concept presentation is asking more for the intuition than precision and playing more on empirical pathway to explaining with, more often than not, concepts used before giving the definition. Anyways, this book might be of use to the newcomers to linear algebra and math in general as this style might be just what they are looking for. The book does a great job at introducing applications of linear algebra and there lies it's great value."

		"Review": "I read the \"South Asian\" edition of this book. I also used to watch Prof. Strang's lectures from https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathemati....The great thing about this book is Prof. Strang provides intuition into a very abstract topic. The way he did that is by using examples to illustrate the concepts. Some concepts in particular, for example linear subspaces and least squares, are beautifully explained.I think the greatest thing I got from this book is this example based thinking to increase my intuition into what would be very abstract topics. Now, whenever I have difficulty understanding some idea or a problem, I draw an example. Unfortunately, I think Prof. Strang went too far with this approach and it failed for Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors. There were two major problems. One, he changed the viewpoint of a matrix multiplication suddenly and without warning, from the combination of vectors to an application of an operator. Two, the theorems of eigenvalues and eigenvectors, which include some very important results for symmetric matrices, are proved in a very obscure way. I was relieved after I finished that section because it was just painful to go through it. The way I learned eigenvectors was to essentially reconstruct from the fragments in the book.Also, I feel that the book is not very clear by itself and is supposed to be used with lectures. Prof. Strang jumps right into the topic in nearly every section without any background or motivation.Overall, despite some shortcomings, I think this is a brilliant introduction to linear algebra. Whether your motivation is to apply linear algebra to some problem or to go into more abstract parts, this book is a great starting point."

If you've watched the lectures it's hard not to like this book but, objectively it appears that the information in the lectures has just been pointed at paper without regard to the fact that the ongoing narrative available in the lectures is missing from the print version.This leaves one having to piece things together oneself, not so much the linear algebra, but what one is supposed to be focusing on. That happened to many times for me so fired up Jeff Holts book.Ron Larson, Kuldeep Singh are also with a look for beginners.Strang's book is a good reference but lacks cohesion for beginners or those who haven't seen his excellent lecture style.Strang is a star, but his book needs an editor!"

The lectures give you the big picture, a good overview. This book then serves to reinforce your understanding of it. I only read the parts of the book relevant to my studies so that's still about 80%. My confidence and understanding of linear algebra is much better; the problem sets are really instructive and all solutions are given on the website. I started this book with the explicit goal of understanding Singular Value Decomposition from first principles, this was in order to augment my existing understanding of the statistical incarnation of SVD: the PCA. There are few resources I can think of that are better at reaching this goal in such a short amount of time. "

		"Review": "For me this book was quite hard to read, because it is often mathematically imprecise. Terms and concepts are used before they are fully introduced. Understanding sentences requires that you have already built up some amount of intuition that you don't usually have when reading an introductory text book.While other math books often build on mathematical rigor alone and neglect building up the reader's intuition, this book neglects rigor in favor of a more intuitive approach. For me this is really difficult to follow, because the exact meaning of sentences is often unclear.Ideally a book would have both rigor and intuition."

A unique pedagogical feature is the starred section at the end of each chapter. Although these sections are not essential to the sequence of the book, they are related to the basic material and offer advanced topics to stimulate the more ambitious student. These topics include power series; existence and uniqueness theorems; Hilbert spaces; Jordan forms; Green's functions; Bernstein polynomials; and the Weierstrass approximation theorem. \n                            This carefully structured textbook provides an ideal, step-by-step transition from first-year calculus to multivariable calculus and, at the same time, enables the instructor to offer special challenges to students ready for more advanced material.\n"

		"Review": "This book doesn't contain info about Gauss elimination, determinant, eigenvals and eigenvecs, rank , conditional number, lu and svd decomposion, you don't get info about how many solutions system has but...only first 200 pages of this book gave me ability to write my own 3d geometric solver. It was so easy and amazing! I had a lot of questions after reading it and I found answers in another book, but I'm happy that this one was my first linear algebra book."

		"Review": "I wanted a relearn linear algebra before I started machine learning. I found this book assessible compared to most linear algebra books, but felt the author spent too much time on explaining applications. I also thought the book could use more direct practice problems with odd njmber solutions in the back. I was also dissappointed that Eigenvalue concepts were not in the book.(I used Khan Academy after this book, which helped my learning goals)"
