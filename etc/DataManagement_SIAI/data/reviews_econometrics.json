		"Description": "Hayashi's Econometrics promises to be the next great synthesis of modern econometrics. It introduces first year Ph.D. students to standard graduate econometrics material from a modern perspective. It covers all the standard material necessary for understanding the principal techniques of econometrics from ordinary least squares through cointegration. The book is also distinctive in developing both time-series and cross-section analysis fully, giving the reader a unified framework for understanding and integrating results. Econometrics has many useful features and covers all the important topics in econometrics in a succinct manner. All the estimation techniques that could possibly be taught in a first-year graduate course, except maximum likelihood, are treated as special cases of GMM (generalized methods of moments). Maximum likelihood estimators for a variety of models (such as probit and tobit) are collected in a separate chapter. This arrangement enables students to learn various estimation techniques in an efficient manner.\n                            Eight of the ten chapters include a serious empirical application drawn from labor economics, industrial organization, domestic and international finance, and macroeconomics. These empirical exercises at the end of each chapter provide students a hands-on experience applying the techniques covered in the chapter. The exposition is rigorous yet accessible to students who have a working knowledge of very basic linear algebra and probability theory. All the results are stated as propositions, so that students can see the points of the discussion and also the conditions under which those results hold. Most propositions are proved in the text. For those who intend to write a thesis on applied topics, the empirical applications of the book are a good way to learn how to conduct empirical research. For the theoretically inclined, the no-compromise treatment of the basic techniques is a good preparation for more advanced theory courses.\n"

		"Review": "I have some misgivings about the field of econometrics, fundamental elements are missing, and traditionally even if GMM estimation, is within the realm of admissable methods in statistics, it is quite fringe. This is also true of MA, ARMA and ARIMA for me, because in the case of economics they are not backed by fundamentals, nor do they elucidate them, given a theoretical mismatched. This is on some level, the same misgivings I have for Robert Lucas Jr.'s attempt to bridge micro to macro, through the use of statistical methods. There is some intuition or concept gap, where certain things are not being bridged. At least from what limited I have read. Perhaps, this is worthy of some further exploration."

		"Review": "A great introduction to graduate-level econometrics, especially because it ties almost everything under a generalized method of moments (GMM) framework (OLS, GLS, IV, 2SLS, SUR, 3SLS, random and fixed effects models, etc.), something which I failed to appreciate until the end of the first year of my graduate econometrics curriculum.The one criticism I have is that occasionally the notation was hard to follow, since most textbooks reserve X for (possibly endogenous) regressors and Z for instruments, whereas Hayashi prefers the complete opposite."

		"Description": "The core methods in today's econometric toolkit are linear regression for statistical control, instrumental variables methods for the analysis of natural experiments, and differences-in-differences methods that exploit policy changes. In the modern experimentalist paradigm, these techniques address clear causal questions such as: Do smaller classes increase learning? Should wife batterers be arrested? How much does education raise wages? Mostly Harmless Econometrics shows how the basic tools of applied econometrics allow the data to speak. In addition to econometric essentials, Mostly Harmless Econometrics covers important new extensions--regression-discontinuity designs and quantile regression--as well as how to get standard errors right. Joshua Angrist and Jorn-Steffen Pischke explain why fancier econometric techniques are typically unnecessary and even dangerous. The applied econometric methods emphasized in this book are easy to use and relevant for many areas of contemporary social science.\n                            * An irreverent review of econometric essentials  * A focus on tools that applied researchers use most  * Chapters on regression-discontinuity designs, quantile regression, and standard errors  * Many empirical examples  * A clear and concise resource with wide applications\n"

		"Review": "The professor of my econometrics class last semester (the first econometrics class I'd ever taken) recommended this book as a supplement to class/our textbook. The book takes a lighthearted (at times humorous) approach, and does a good job explaining the big picture. However, it seems to not really be for people who have taken only one class in the subject, so I spent a lot of time either going back through the textbook or just plain confused. It's clearly a very good resource, but I would have gotten much more out of it if I had more background in the field."

		"Review": "Well, the general framing of this book is just awful. Having no prior knowledge of econometrics and reading it is a pure waste of time as it assumes a great amount of a priori knowledge. Therefore I consider it to be extremely problematic that nowhere in the beginning the target audience is clearly defined. And even if you have a decent amount of knowledge in econometrics this is not going to be easy. To be honest I read this book while working through Woolridge's famous Econometric Analysis of Cross-Section and Panel-Data and for every 10 pages I read in the Woolridge I was just able to understand one in Mostly Harmless Econometrics. Wrapping your head around the conditional-expectation-causal-analysis framework is time-consuming, but on the other hand it describes a perspective on econometrics and empirical research in a totally different way and gives many fascinating insights. But to really appreciate that you need some good foundations in statistics and econometrics. Therefore I consider this book to be everything but not harmless."

		"Review": "Not an introductory book to econometrics for sure, but if you've already taken courses that cover basic asymptotics and have been introduced to stuff like instrumental variables and fixed effects models, you are going to get a lot of mileage out of this book.Angrist and Pischke put causal identification and inference front-and-center in this book, beginning with Rubin's potential outcomes model, the selection bias problem, and the ideal of a randomized experiment. In practice, we are often stuck with observational data, so a second-best identification strategy will involve seeking out natural or quasi-experiments. This is where the authors really shine, often using classic papers as case studies in, say, differences-in-differences or regression discontinuity design.At times they skip over the technical details on certain topics, which is why I'm only giving it 4/5, but to be honest their main concern is general ideas and providing the reader some tricks of the trade. If you want to see why a fixed effects estimator is asymptotically more efficient than a first differences estimator, go read Jeff Wooldridge's Econometric Analysis. If you want a great sampling of an experimentalist perspective on econometric issues, this is a must-have."

		"Review": "This is an excellent book on causal inference for econometrics and related problems (many observations, some unobserved covariates, no randomized experiment or only partial compliance in the experiment). If you want to learn about propensity score matching, discontinuity regression, and a hell of a lot about instrumental variables, this is the book for you.As a minimum preparation, I think you would need to read and clearly understand parts 1 and 2 of Data Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical Models before reading this book. It is written in a style which is at times humorous, but don't let this mislead you into thinking that it is for a general audience; this is a highly technical book and at times it's tough going. You'll want a thorough understanding of the linear algebra behind OLS, and this book is often cursory on the derivations."

		"Review": "Defining a target audience for this book is difficult: It mixes conversational style with heavy derivations. The authors choice to frame all of their expositions in a less common framework does not help lowering the complexity.The derivations and difficult language, mixed in with some missing explanations and missing higher-level framing of the different topics make this book fairly unaccessible at an even with some level of knowledge in the area of (micro)econometrics, and should potentially be consumed together with a more textbook-style work, which explains the contents within the context.For more seasoned practitioners, the authors offer some interesting insights in interpretations of model estimates and potentially some (new?) ideas for model designs. The framing of the models in the conditional expectations framework may be insightful, but requires very close reading. But crucially, this book misses out on many more detailed mathematical/statistical/econometrical explanations. I can see that this book could be used as a starting point to dig deeper into one (or more) of the cited texts, or to reflect on some of the user's practices. The review by A. Gelman at https://doi.org/10.1177/1536867X09009... gives a more insight into more technical issues with the book.In addition to these, I found the style of writing and layout of the book difficult to follow, which is extremely dense in some areas and very wordy at others, which is a lot to digest when reading the book front-to-back. I do not think this book works good as a reference work either, due to interdependencies between chapters. (The authors seem to have been aware of this, there is some amount of repetition happening.)This book is only occasionally harmless, and lacks in some areas of its writing. You may be better off buying a \"proper\" textbook on microeconometrics, such as Wooldridge or Cameron."

It's a question we'd like to get right.This is one of two books I can think of off the top of my head (Weisberg's is the other) which foregrounds _what_does_regression_actually_mean_. Versus the mathematical process.On the other hand, maybe statistical measures like lm beta and sd are nothing more than high-dimensional hypotenuse constructions. Most of what people want to know from lm questions could be answered by looking at random subsets of treatment group and non-treatment group, then drilling down with counter-questions that come from real world common sense.Using a concrete example from a random popular armchair bullshitter https://twitter.com/clairlemon/status..., people have various ideas about why divorced men might be less productive, and subgroups / extra data columns, if they're available, might be used to answer some of these real-world counter questions.If the gritty details of subscripts and high-dimensional hypotenuses weren't so focussed on, the time used to understand the minutiae of these arguments could instead be used to read the data collection methodology and variable definitions, which in my experience always swamp debates about what the algebra \"means\"."

The majority of this book is about types of models. There is much discussion about the mathematical consequences for various models, but not much discussion about how to select models per data -- the examples are selected in order to align with the mathematics and not the other way around.I intend to read this again when I have a little more meat on my stats."

		"Review": "A book such as this serves no purpose in this day and age when one can easily get terse summaries of different statistical and econometric techniques from Wikipedia. This book has an awful lot of words but very few examples of how to apply many of techniques in practice, so often it doesn't really help when you have a confusion that you're trying to clear up. If William Greene's Econometric Analysis is too mathematical, at least it has good examples of how to apply that math and sometimes the math can yield good intuition.This book certainly doesn't claim to be the most rigorous text and so I don't judge it as such, but it also provide very little value if what you seek is intuition. Better to skip it and find another book."

		"Review": "Many folks hate the \"For Dummies\" series, for it tries sometimes too hard to simplify complex subjects and ultimately fails at doing so. But this book for me was really the opposite.At its foundation, Econometrics is a complex subject that should be treated with extreme care. Even if the empiricist turn in Economics might be a bit overrated given how empiricists are not deemed in regard as high as theoreticians, it is what unveils evidence that will back or contradict the field's foundations, and open new ways for it to engage in new areas of thought.I wouldn't recommend this book as anything other than something to consult when you really want to remind yourself of some very basic concepts in Econometrics that might have been long forgotten in your mind, if you're a veteran like me. But if I ever have to teach Econometrics to a bunch of first and/or second-year students at some institution where people still struggle with basic calculus and linear algebra, I wouldn't be opposed to the idea of using this book as a secondary reference to my peers. As there is certainly something to grasp from here that might be lost from the bunch of equations thrown at you by most of the classic Econometrics textbooks out there."

		"Description": "Gain an understanding of how econometrics can answer today's questions in business, policy evaluation and forecasting with Wooldridge's INTRODUCTORY ECONOMETRICS: A MODERN APPROACH, 7E. Unlike traditional texts, this book's practical, yet professional, approach demonstrates how econometrics has moved beyond a set of abstract tools to become genuinely useful for answering questions across a variety of disciplines.\n\n                            The author has organized the book's presentation around the type of data being analyzed with a systematic approach that only introduces assumptions as they are needed. This makes the material easier to understand and, ultimately, leads to better econometric practices. Packed with relevant applications, the text incorporates more than 100  data sets in different formats. Updates introduce the latest developments in the field, including the recent advances in the so-called \"causal effects\" or \"treatment effects,\" to provide a complete understanding of the impact and importance of econometrics today.\n"

You start as a novice and at the end you can perform serious research and understand the papers based on econometric approach. Few sub-chapters and may be chapters 17 and 18 are hard to follow but otherwise you can have a fun reading the textbook. I would highlight chapter 8 on heteroskedasticity, chapters 13 and 14 on pooled crossed section and panel data, or chapter 15 on Insturmetal variables. You can read them as a novel. You will want to read them through before going to bed and you will be tempted to start some empirical project asap. "

Both books covered the same material more-or-less, but I guess it is a question of where your interests and prior knowledge of applied probability and statistics are at before taking a course in econometrics."

		"Description": "The second edition of a comprehensive state-of-the-art graduate level text on microeconometric methods, substantially revised and updated.\n\n                            The second edition of this acclaimed graduate text provides a unified treatment of two methods used in contemporary econometric research, cross section and data panel methods. By focusing on assumptions that can be given behavioral content, the book maintains an appropriate level of rigor while emphasizing intuitive thinking. The analysis covers both linear and nonlinear models, including models with dynamics and/or individual heterogeneity. In addition to general estimation frameworks (particular methods of moments and maximum likelihood), specific linear and nonlinear methods are covered in detail, including probit and logit models and their multivariate, Tobit models, models for count data, censored and missing data schemes, causal (or treatment) effects, and duration analysis.\n\n                            Econometric Analysis of Cross Section and Panel Data was the first graduate econometrics text to focus on microeconomic data structures, allowing assumptions to be separated into population and sampling assumptions. This second edition has been substantially updated and revised. Improvements include a broader class of models for missing data problems; more detailed treatment of cluster problems, an important topic for empirical researchers; expanded discussion of generalized instrumental variables (GIV) estimation; new coverage (based on the author's own recent research) of inverse probability weighting; a more complete framework for estimating treatment effects with panel data, and a firmly established link between econometric approaches to nonlinear panel data and the generalized estimating equation literature popular in statistics and other fields. New attention is given to explaining when particular econometric methods can be applied; the goal is not only to tell readers what does work, but why certain obvious procedures do not. The numerous included exercises, both theoretical and computer-based, allow the reader to extend methods covered in the text and discover new insights.\n"

		"Description": "The past twenty years have seen an extraordinary growth in the use of quantitative methods in financial markets. Finance professionals now routinely use sophisticated statistical techniques in portfolio management, proprietary trading, risk management, financial consulting, and securities regulation. This graduate-level textbook is intended for PhD students, advanced MBA students, and industry professionals interested in the econometrics of financial modeling. The book covers the entire spectrum of empirical finance, including: the predictability of asset returns, tests of the Random Walk Hypothesis, the microstructure of securities markets, event analysis, the Capital Asset Pricing Model and the Arbitrage Pricing Theory, the term structure of interest rates, dynamic models of economic equilibrium, and nonlinear financial models such as ARCH, neural networks, statistical fractals, and chaos theory. Each chapter develops statistical techniques within the context of a particular financial application. This exciting new text contains a unique and accessible combination of theory and practice, bringing state-of-the-art statistical techniques to the forefront of financial applications.\n                            Each chapter also includes a discussion of recent empirical evidence, for example, the rejection of the Random Walk Hypothesis, as well as problems designed to help readers incorporate what they have read into their own applications\n"

		"Review": "It's not good. If you already understand what's going on, it seems like a decent textbook, but Stock & Watson often lack clarity in their explanations. This book is 1) nearly impossible to skim because of the writing style 2) very bad in terms of making connections to other theories and applications and ideas 3) devoid of metaphor and 4) bad at concisely explaining equations. A good mathematical textbook gives you an important equation and then explains it for the next paragraph, telling you what all the variables mean, what happens if some of them change, what this means, etc. S&W often don't even tell you what variables mean, and you might have to go three pages back in the book to figure out that the variable p is supposed to stand for \"the number of lags.\" And the amount of times they say something like \"and we can prove this because it's just like equation (8.7),\" and then don't even mention what equation 8.7 is infuriating. They expect you to go back 200 pages to equation 8.7 (which, by the way, has no concise explanation, so you're going to need to read the five pages around equation 8.7 to figure out what it means). It's like reading a research paper that leaves page numbers without quotations--it treats me like I'm too stupid to do the thinking myself."

Typical academic fair whereby the author is too far removed from his audience (an introductory one) so that much is lost."

		"Description": "This outstanding text by a foremost econometrician combines instruction in probability and statistics with econometrics in a rigorous but relatively nontechnical manner. Unlike many statistics texts, it discusses regression analysis in depth. And unlike many econometrics texts, it offers a thorough treatment of statistics. Although its only mathematical requirement is multivariate calculus, it challenges the student to think deeply about basic concepts.\n\n                            The coverage of probability and statistics includes best prediction and best linear prediction, the joint distribution of a continuous and discrete random variable, large sample theory, and the properties of the maximum likelihood estimator. Exercises at the end of each chapter reinforce the many illustrative examples and diagrams. Believing that students should acquire the habit of questioning conventional statistical techniques, Takeshi Amemiya discusses the problem of choosing estimators and compares various criteria for ranking them. He also evaluates classical hypothesis testing critically, giving the realistic case of testing a composite null against a composite alternative. He frequently adopts a Bayesian approach because it provides a useful pedagogical framework for discussing many fundamental issues in statistical inference.\n\n                            Turning to regression, Amemiya presents the classical bivariate model in the conventional summation notation. He follows with a brief introduction to matrix analysis and multiple regression in matrix notation. Finally, he describes various generalizations of the classical regression model and certain other statistical models extensively used in econometrics and other applications in social science.\n"

Two new chapters at the start of the book have been developed from material originally in Wooldridge's appendix section to serve as a clear introduction to the subject and as a revision tool that bridges students' transition from basic statistics into econometrics. \n\n                            This adaptation includes data sets from Australian and New Zealand, as well as from the Asia-Pacific region to suit the significant portion of finance students who are from Asia and the likelihood that many graduates will find employment overseas.\n"

Wooldridge's Introduction to Econometrics shows how econometrics is a useful tool for answering questions in business, policy evaluation and forecasting environments. Packed with timely, relevant applications, the text incorporates close to 100 intriguing data sets, available in six formats, with appendices and questions available online.\n\n                            Unique organization pioneered by the author clearly presents applications for today's students. This comprehensive econometrics text pioneered the approach of explicitly covering cross-sectional applications first, followed by time series applications, and, ultimately, panel data applications in the advanced chapters.\n\n                            Practical application prepares students to use econometrics in business today. This unique, comprehensive text applies econometrics to actual real business problems, demonstrating how each method answers a particular issue facing researchers who are analyzing non-experimental data.\n"

You start as a novice and at the end you can perform serious research and understand the papers based on econometric approach. Few sub-chapters and may be chapters 17 and 18 are hard to follow but otherwise you can have a fun reading the textbook. I would highlight chapter 8 on heteroskedasticity, chapters 13 and 14 on pooled crossed section and panel data, or chapter 15 on Insturmetal variables. You can read them as a novel. You will want to read them through before going to bed and you will be tempted to start some empirical project asap. "

		"Review": "Having already read Stock and Watson's econometrics book, I do say that I found Wooldridge's simultaneously (1) more technical and challenging and (2) ultimately more useful, especially when working with the provided datasets (if you have R, go ahead and install the 'wooldridge' package when reading this book). Both books covered the same material more-or-less, but I guess it is a question of where your interests and prior knowledge of applied probability and statistics are at before taking a course in econometrics."

		"Description": "R is a language and environment for data analysis and graphics. It may be considered an implementation of S, an award-winning language initially - veloped at Bell Laboratories since the late 1970s. The R project was initiated by Robert Gentleman and Ross Ihaka at the University of Auckland, New Zealand, in the early 1990s, and has been developed by an international team since mid-1997. Historically, econometricians have favored other computing environments, some of which have fallen by the wayside, and also a variety of packages with canned routines. We believe that R has great potential in econometrics, both for research and for teaching. There are at least three reasons for this: (1) R is mostly platform independent and runs on Microsoft Windows, the Mac family of operating systems, and various ?avors of Unix/Linux, and also on some more exotic platforms. (2) R is free software that can be downloaded and installed at no cost from a family of mirror sites around the globe, the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN); hence students can easily install it on their own machines. (3) R is open-source software, so that the full source code is available and can be inspected to understand what it really does, learn from it, and modify and extend it. We also like to think that platform independence and the open-source philosophy make R an ideal environment for reproducible econometric research.\n"

		"Description": "Until now, students and researchers in nonparametric and semiparametric statistics and econometrics have had to turn to the latest journal articles to keep pace with these emerging methods of economic analysis. Nonparametric Econometrics fills a major gap by gathering together the most up-to-date theory and techniques and presenting them in a remarkably straightforward and accessible format. The empirical tests, data, and exercises included in this textbook help make it the ideal introduction for graduate students and an indispensable resource for researchers. Nonparametric and semiparametric methods have attracted a great deal of attention from statisticians in recent decades. While the majority of existing books on the subject operate from the presumption that the underlying data is strictly continuous in nature, more often than not social scientists deal with categorical data--nominal and ordinal--in applied settings. The conventional nonparametric approach to dealing with the presence of discrete variables is acknowledged to be unsatisfactory. This book is tailored to the needs of applied econometricians and social scientists.\n                            Qi Li and Jeffrey Racine emphasize nonparametric techniques suited to the rich array of data types--continuous, nominal, and ordinal--within one coherent framework. They also emphasize the properties of nonparametric estimators in the presence of potentially irrelevant variables. Nonparametric Econometrics covers all the material necessary to understand and apply nonparametric methods for real-world problems.\n"

This text focuses on explaining why econometrics exists and how it can be used in everyday life. This text adopts a strong student-focused approach to the discipline. In doing so, it aims to address fundamental issues in econometrics in an accessible manner for students, who are often put off by the difficult nature of econometrics.\n"

		"Description": "Time series econometrics is a rapidly evolving field. Particularly, the cointegration revolution has had a substantial impact on applied analysis. Hence, no textbook has managed to cover the full range of methods in current use and explain how to proceed in applied domains. This gap in the literature motivates the present volume. The methods are sketched out, reminding the reader of the ideas underlying them and giving sufficient background for empirical work. The treatment can also be used as a textbook for a course on applied time series econometrics. Topics include: unit root and cointegration analysis, structural vector autoregressions, conditional heteroskedasticity and nonlinear and nonparametric time series models. Crucial to empirical work is the software that is available for analysis. New methodology is typically only gradually incorporated into existing software packages. Therefore a flexible Java interface has been created, allowing readers to replicate the applications and conduct their own analyses.\n"

Derived from the course taught by Arthur S. Goldberger at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and at Stanford University, it is specifically designed for use over two semesters, offers students the most thorough grounding in introductory statistical inference, and offers a substantial amount of interpretive material. The text brims with insights, strikes a balance between rigor and intuition, and provokes students to form their own critical opinions.\n\n                            A Course in Econometrics thoroughly covers the fundamentals-classical regression and simultaneous equations-and offers clear and logical explorations of asymptotic theory and nonlinear regression. To accommodate students with various levels of preparation, the text opens with a thorough review of statistical concepts and methods, then proceeds to the regression model and its variants. Bold subheadings introduce and highlight key concepts throughout each chapter.\n\n                            Each chapter concludes with a set of exercises specifically designed to reinforce and extend the material covered. Many of the exercises include real microdata analyses, and all are ideally suited to use as homework and test questions.\n"

		"Description": "A concise treatment of modern econometrics and statistics, including underlying ideas from linear algebra, probability theory, and computer programming.\n\n                            This book offers a cogent and concise treatment of econometric theory and methods along with the underlying ideas from statistics, probability theory, and linear algebra. It emphasizes foundations and general principles, but also features many solved exercises, worked examples, and code listings. After mastering the material presented, readers will be ready to take on more advanced work in different areas of quantitative economics and to understand papers from the econometrics literature. The book can be used in graduate-level courses on foundational aspects of econometrics or on fundamental statistical principles. It will also be a valuable reference for independent study.\n\n                            One distinctive aspect of the text is its integration of traditional topics from statistics and econometrics with modern ideas from data science and machine learning; readers will encounter ideas that are driving the current development of statistics and increasingly filtering into econometric methodology. The text treats programming not only as a way to work with data but also as a technique for building intuition via simulation. Many proofs are followed by a simulation that shows the theory in action. As a primer, the book offers readers an entry point into the field, allowing them to see econometrics as a whole rather than as a profusion of apparently unrelated ideas.\n"

		"Description": "Providing an introduction to mathematical analysis as it applies to economic theory and econometrics, this book bridges the gap that has separated the teaching of basic mathematics for economics and the increasingly advanced mathematics demanded in economics research today. Dean Corbae, Maxwell B. Stinchcombe, and Juraj Zeman equip students with the knowledge of real and functional analysis and measure theory they need to read and do research in economic and econometric theory. Unlike other mathematics textbooks for economics, An Introduction to Mathematical Analysis for Economic Theory and Econometrics takes a unified approach to understanding basic and advanced spaces through the application of the Metric Completion Theorem. This is the concept by which, for example, the real numbers complete the rational numbers and measure spaces complete fields of measurable sets. Another of the book's unique features is its concentration on the mathematical foundations of econometrics. To illustrate difficult concepts, the authors use simple examples drawn from economic theory and econometrics.\n                            Accessible and rigorous, the book is self-contained, providing proofs of theorems and assuming only an undergraduate background in calculus and linear algebra. * Begins with mathematical analysis and economic examples accessible to advanced undergraduates in order to build intuition for more complex analysis used by graduate students and researchers  * Takes a unified approach to understanding basic and advanced spaces of numbers through application of the Metric Completion Theorem  * Focuses on examples from econometrics to explain topics in measure theory\n"

		"Review": "Interactive Guide to UNDERSTANDING econometrics: When I was a new graduate student I ended up buying several different econometrics texts. No one text had the best explanation for each topic. The problem remained that for many topics I never did find a book which translated the formal mathematical presentation into a practical worked out example, so that I could understand the procedure and how to implement it.  This book and accompanying CD-ROM does that and much more.  Every topic includes guided Microsoft Excel spreadsheets and add-ins which illustrate the topic being addressed. The text clearly explains not only the HOW, but the WHY. The economics and the econometrics are presented with such clarity and unity; bridging the two in a way that none of the other texts do.  In Barreto and Howlands book/CD package you interact with the data and the graphs (they include a superior add-in for creating histograms), and run Monte Carlo simulations to see the behavior of the estimators in repeated sampling. These are \"live\" spreadsheets that invite you to experiment. For example; there is an Excel workbook which illustrates the correlation coefficient. Rather than a dry recitation of formula and proof, you can interact with the spreadsheet and see exactly how the same coefficient can apply to data having very different patterns. It is one thing to see an illustration, and quite another to actually be the one creating the diagram, simply by running the macros and changing parameters. This \"hands on\" approach is so vital to actually getting an understanding of the material. I have only a basic understanding of Excel, and have had no difficulties in using the workbooks.  While the limits of Excel are pointed out by the authors, it is important to note the reason for using Excel. It is widely understood and available; there is no learning curve. By using Excel there is no software barrier between the student and understanding the principles of econometric modelling. In less than 1/2 hour I took the data and example of a Probit model using Maximum Likelihood estimation from a course web site from across the country and replicated the results using the add-in provided. Most of that time was used to extract the data from a .pdf file and get it formatted properly for Excel. Once I had the data in Excel, it took less than 2 minutes to run the Probit estimation (my first time using that add-in!) By the way, the results using the authors add-in for solving Probit models with ML estimation were the same as the results from GAUSS code to do the same. The add-in had a distinct advantage though in that a choice for Probit or Logit model estimation using either Non Linear Least Squares or the Maximum Likelihood estimation was just a radio button away! This text can complement any course, regardless of the software used.  Again, the beauty of the book is that you are not just left with Greek formulas that leave you wondering how to do the computations, and you are not left with computer output leaving you to wonder how to interpret that output. The text explains the meaning so powerfully that you are not only armed with an understanding which is useful for success in your course work, but also for applying the quantitative tools in real world analysis and applications. The text is like going to see your favorite professor who is sitting there with you one on one, giving you insight which only comes from experience.  I've been through courses that use Greene, and Judge, as well as introductory texts. This text stands alone in making use of the computing power we have at our disposal today, not to produce more computer printouts, but rather to increase our understanding--providing the sound reasoning for applying that power.  I should add that even after two years of statistics and econometrics I learned quite a lot from the statistics review chapters. Don't be misled by the \"Introductory\" title. I had learned and executed Artificial Neural Network models in graduate courses, but still learned a lot from the section on correlation in this book. For undergrad students this book will put you on the right path. For grad students it will correct blind spots and misconceptions.  I highly recommend this book/CD package to any econometrics student and to practicing analysts that use regression analysis. The authors have created a product that I wish I had when I was in school, but am glad I found now for applying in my career.  Detailed info on contents as well as the Excel files and add-ins are available from the authors' web site which I found prior to ordering from Amazon. Once I tried the workbooks, I knew I wanted the book. It's 800 pages of solid information and inspired teaching.  http://www.wabash.edu/econometrics/in..."

		"Description": "This book is the definitive user's guide to the spatial regression functionality in the software packages GeoDa and GeoDaSpace, as well as the spreg module in the PySAL library --all developed at the GeoDa Center for Geospatial Analysis and Computation. The book provides the techniques to test for and estimate spatial effects in linear regression models, addressing both spatial dependence (spatial autoregressive models) as well as spatial heterogeneity (spatial regimes models). The book also serves as an introduction and a practical guide to spatial econometrics in that it covers the methodological principles and formal results that underlie the various estimation methods, test procedures and model characteristics computed by the software. While the classical maximum likelihood estimation is included, the book's coverage emphasizes modern techniques based on the principle of generalized method of moments (GMM).\n"

		"Description": "This book provides a general framework for specifying, estimating and testing time series econometric models. Special emphasis is given to estimation by maximum likelihood, but other methods are also discussed, including quasi-maximum likelihood estimation, generalised method of moments estimation, nonparametric estimation and estimation by simulation. An important advantage of adopting the principle of maximum likelihood as the unifying framework for the book is that many of the estimators and test statistics proposed in econometrics can be derived within a likelihood framework, thereby providing a coherent vehicle for understanding their properties and interrelationships. In contrast to many existing econometric textbooks, which deal mainly with the theoretical properties of estimators and test statistics through a theorem-proof presentation, this book squarely addresses implementation to provide direct conduits between the theory and applied work.\n"

		"Review": "Before reading this textbook, I was effectively lost in the middle of many econometric methods that I could not connect together. In addition to that, my weak background in theoretical mathematics stood as a barrier to understanding econometric theory taught at my university.This textbook is self-contained and assumes no mathematical knowledge beyond calculus, basic linear algebra and statistics. All mathematical methods that are needed are introduced within chapters in a very intuitive way. The book starts from the basics of econometric theory and progresses to derive and prove common methods used at PhD level. This is done with a rich discussion that leaves little space for confusion.The book helped me develop my understanding such that I am now able to navigate different methods according to the problem at hand and assumptions that could be made. For example, it helped me have an intuitive understanding of what the weighting matrix should be for the feasible efficient GMM that I could always remember.I would recommend reading all chapters of the book as they contain a common theme and draw a natural line of progression to help understand how everything connects together."

		"Description": "Although interest in spatial regression models has surged in recent years, a comprehensive, up-to-date text on these approaches does not exist. Filling this void, Introduction to Spatial Econometrics presents a variety of regression methods used to analyze spatial data samples that violate the traditional assumption of independence between observations. It explores a wide range of alternative topics, including maximum likelihood and Bayesian estimation, various types of spatial regression specifications, and applied modeling situations involving different circumstances.\n\n                            Leaders in this field, the authors clarify the often-mystifying phenomenon of simultaneous spatial dependence. By presenting new methods, they help with the interpretation of spatial regression models, especially ones that include spatial lags of the dependent variable. The authors also examine the relationship between spatiotemporal processes and long-run equilibrium states that are characterized by simultaneous spatial dependence. MATLAB (R) toolboxes useful for spatial econometric estimation are available on the authors' websites.\n\n                            This work covers spatial econometric modeling as well as numerous applied illustrations of the methods. It encompasses many recent advances in spatial econometric models-including some previously unpublished results.\n"

		"Description": "High-frequency trading is an algorithm-based computerized trading practice that allows firms to trade stocks in milliseconds. Over the last fifteen years, the use of statistical and econometric methods for analyzing high-frequency financial data has grown exponentially. This growth has been driven by the increasing availability of such data, the technological advancements that make high-frequency trading strategies possible, and the need of practitioners to analyze these data. This comprehensive book introduces readers to these emerging methods and tools of analysis.  Yacine Ait-Sahalia and Jean Jacod cover the mathematical foundations of stochastic processes, describe the primary characteristics of high-frequency financial data, and present the asymptotic concepts that their analysis relies on. Ait-Sahalia and Jacod also deal with estimation of the volatility portion of the model, including methods that are robust to market microstructure noise, and address estimation and testing questions involving the jump part of the model.\n                            As they demonstrate, the practical importance and relevance of jumps in financial data are universally recognized, but only recently have econometric methods become available to rigorously analyze jump processes.  Ait-Sahalia and Jacod approach high-frequency econometrics with a distinct focus on the financial side of matters while maintaining technical rigor, which makes this book invaluable to researchers and practitioners alike.\n"

The analysis starts with density estimation and motivates the procedures through methods that should be familiar to the reader. It then moves on to kernel regression, estimation with discrete data, and advanced methods such as estimation with panel data and instrumental variables models. The book pays close attention to the issues that arise with programming, computing speed, and application. In each chapter, the methods discussed are applied to actual data, paying attention to presentation of results and potential pitfalls.\n"

It is also a helpful tool for those who like to learn by solving exercises and running software to replicate empirical studies. It works as a complementary study guide to Baltagi (2008) and also as a stand alone book that builds up the reader's confidence in working out difficult exercises in panel data econometrics and applying these methods to empirical work. The exercises start by providing some background information on partitioned regressions and the Frisch-Waugh-Lovell theorem. Then it goes through the basic material on fixed and random effects models in a one-way and two-way error components models: basic estimation, test of hypotheses and prediction. This include maximum likelihood estimation, testing for poolability of the data, testing for the significance of individual and time effects, as well as Hausman's test for correlated effects.\n                            It also provides extensions of panel data techniques to serial correlation, spatial correlation, heteroskedasticity, seemingly unrelated regressions, simultaneous equations, dynamic panel models, incomplete panels, measurement error, count panels, rotating panels, limited dependent variables, and non-stationary panels. The book provides several empirical examples that are useful to applied researchers, illustrating them using Stata and EViews showing the reader how to replicate these studies.

		"Description": "This advanced textbook is an essential guide to discovering new and more illuminating ways to analyse the econometric modelling of experimental data. Peter Moffatt, one of the world's experts in the field, covers a range of techniques: from the familiar, such as treatment testing, to lesser known ones such as finite mixture models and the method of maximum simulated likelihood. The book takes a hands-on approach by explaining STATA commands in detail. In addition, difficult problems inherent in the methodology are addressed, such as the parametric estimation of social preference models, quantal response models, and learning models.\n\n                             An indispensable book for researchers and advanced students in experimental and behavioural economics who want to come to grips with the field of Experimetrics.\n\n                            The companion website www.palgrave.com/moffatt contains:\n                            - All data sets (in Stata format) used as examples in the book\n                            - An executable Stata 'do-file' containing stata commands and programs used in examples\n\n                            And\n                            - An Excel file containing some Excel calculations presented in the text\n"

		"Description": "Advanced Econometrics is both a comprehensive text for graduate students and a reference work for econometricians. It will also be valuable to those doing statistical analysis in the other social sciences. Its main features are a thorough treatment of cross-section models, including qualitative response models, censored and truncated regression models, and Markov and duration models, as well as a rigorous presentation of large sample theory, classical least-squares and generalized least-squares theory, and nonlinear simultaneous equation models.\n\n                            Although the treatment is mathematically rigorous, the author has employed the theorem-proof method with simple, intuitively accessible assumptions. This enables readers to understand the basic structure of each theorem and to generalize it for themselves depending on their needs and abilities. Many simple applications of theorems are given either in the form of examples in the text or as exercises at the end of each chapter in order to demonstrate their essential points.\n"

		"Review": "I took Amemiya's advanced econometrics class in graduate school and I cannot imagine a better introduction to graduate econometrics. The book reflects Amemiya's brilliance; topics are presented lucidly and logically. However, this book requires some mathematical background -- real analysis and linear algebra -- and is not a good first text in econometrics. Overall, I highly recommend it for people who want to learn how to think like an econometrician. It is absolutely essential for practicing econometricians."

		"Description": "Introduction to Econometrics has been written as a core textbook for a first course in econometrics taken by undergraduate or graduate students. It is intended for students taking a single course in econometrics with a view towards doing practical data work. It will also be highly useful for students interested in understanding the basics of econometric theory with a view towards future study of advanced econometrics. To achieve this end, it has a practical emphasis, showing how a wide variety of models can be used with the types of data sets commonly used by economists. However, it also has enough discussion of the underlying econometric theory to give the student a knowledge of the statistical tools used in advanced econometrics courses. Key Features: * A non-technical summary of the basic tools of econometrics is given in chapters 1 and 2, which allows the reader to quickly start empirical work. * The foundation offered in the first two chapters makes the theoretical econometric material, which begins in chapter 3, more accessible. * Provides a good balance between econometric theory and empirical applications.\n                            * Discusses a wide range of models used by applied economists including many variants of the regression model (with extensions for panel data), time series models (including a discussion of unit roots and cointegration) and qualitative choice models (probit and logit). An extensive collection of web-based supplementary materials is provided for this title, including: data sets, problem sheets with worked through answers, empirical projects, sample exercises with answers, and slides for lecturers.

		"Description": "The interactions that occur in securities markets are among the fastest, most information-intensive, and most highly strategic of all economic phenomena. Empirical Market Microstructure is about the institutions that have evolved to handle our trading needs, the economic forces that guide our strategies, and statistical methods of using and interpreting the vast amount of information that these markets produce.  The empirical methods\n                            discussed in the book draw on the power of multivariate linear time series analysis. The book discusses the application of univariate ARMA analysis to trade prices, vector autoregressions to price and order\n                            data, and vector error correction models to situations where the same security is traded in many markets. In these models, the tools of random-walk decomposition and co-integration emerge as important to specification and interpretation.   The statistical specifications dont simply arise, however, as progressively more refined descriptive models; they have strong economic underpinnings arising from asymmetric information, inventory control, and the strategies of their\n                            participants. These topics are discusssed, interleaving with and emphasizing the connection to the statistical models.   From a practical viewpoint, many of these models will be\n                            estimated to calibrate real-world trading strategies. Some market participants will be trying to discern strategies that generate profits from short-term trading. A much greater number, though, will be trying to accomplish trades that help diversify, hedge or reallocate a portfolio. Trading is not, for these agents, their primary economic purpose. They are simply trying to satisfy their trading needs at a minimal cost. The final part of the book discusses how these costs are measured, and\n                            strategies to minimize them--both by splitting orders over time, and by the judicious use of limit orders.   The book includes numerous exercises; solutions and other supporting\n                            materials are available on the author's web site.\n"

It defines the likelihood function, prior distributions and posterior distributions. It explains how posterior distributions are the basis for inference and explores their basic properties. Various methods of specifying prior distributions are considered, with special emphasis on subject-matter considerations and exchange ability. The regression model is examined to show how analytical methods may fail in the derivation of marginal posterior distributions. The remainder of the book is concerned with applications of the theory to important models that are used in economics, political science, biostatistics and other applied fields. New to the second edition is a chapter on semiparametric regression and new sections on the ordinal probit, item response, factor analysis, ARCH-GARCH and stochastic volatility models. The new edition also emphasizes the R programming language.\n"

		"Description": "Aspects of environmental change are some of the greatest challenges faced by policymakers today. The key issues addressed by environmental science are often empirical, and in many instances very detailed, sizable datasets are available. Researchers in this field should have a solid understanding of the econometric tools best suited for analysis of these data. While complex and expensive physical models of the environment exist, it is becoming increasingly clear that reduced-form econometric models have an important role to play in modeling environmental phenomena. In short, successful environmental modeling does not necessarily require a structural model, but the econometric methods underlying a reduced-form approach must be competently executed. \n\n\n                            Environmental Econometrics Using Stata provides an important starting point for this journey by presenting a broad range of applied econometric techniques for environmental econometrics and illustrating how they can be applied in Stata. The emphasis is not only on how to formulate and fit models in Stata but also on the need to use a wide range of diagnostic tests in order to validate the results of estimation and subsequent policy conclusions. This focus on careful, reproducible research should be appreciated by academic and non-academic researchers who are seeking to produce credible, defensible conclusions about key issues in environmental science.\n"

Several of the chapters focus on conditional heteroskedasticity, and develop the ideas of Engle's Nobel Prize winning work. Engle's work has had its most profound effect on the modelling of financial variables and several of the chapters use newly developed time series methods to study the\n                            behavior of financial variables.

		"Description": "Putting Econometrics in its Place is an original and fascinating book, in which Peter Swann argues that econometrics has dominated applied economics for far too long and displaced other essential techniques. While Peter Swann is critical of the monopoly that econometrics currently holds in applied economics, the more important and positive contribution of the book is to propose a new direction and a new attitude to applied economics.\n\n                            The advance of econometrics from its early days has been a massive achievement, but it has also been problematic; practical results from the use of econometrics are often disappointing. The author argues that to get applied economics back on course economists must use a much wider variety of research techniques, and must once again learn to respect vernacular knowledge of the economy. This vernacular includes the knowledge gathered by ordinary people from their everyday interactions with markets. While vernacular knowledge is often unsystematic and informal, it offers insights that can never be found from formal analysis alone. \n\n                            As a serious, original and sometimes contentious book, its readership will be varied and international. Scholars throughout the many fields of economics - both skilled and unskilled in econometrics - are likely to be intrigued by the serious alternative approaches outlined within the book. It will also appeal to communities of economists outside economics departments in government, industry and business as well as business and management schools. Research centres for applied economics, policy research and innovation research, will also find it of interest due to its focus on getting reliable results rather than methodological orthodoxy for its own sake.\n"

Within this framework this is the first book to discuss the principles of the nonparametric approach to the topics covered in a first year graduate course in econometrics, e.g. regression function, heteroskedasticity, simultaneous equations models, logit-probit and censored models. Nonparametric and semiparametric methods potentially offer considerable reward to applied researchers, owing to the methods' ability to adapt to many unknown features of the data. Professors Pagan and Ullah provide intuitive explanations of difficult concepts, heuristic developments of theory, and empirical examples emphasizing the usefulness of the modern nonparametric approach. The book should provide a new perspective on teaching and research in applied subjects in general and econometrics and statistics in particular.\n"

On several occasions, I stared in bewilderment at the page wondering how exactly parts of this were published. Bailey simply can't resist making a quip here and there, and on occasion are so jarring that they actually distract from the course material. Real Econometrics doesn't function particularly well as a reference guide either, though it most certainly isn't written as one. Despite this, however, Real Econometrics is extremely well-presented and well-written, and I would recommend it for any introductory econometrics course. Overall, this textbook is a good introduction to economic research, if perhaps a little shocking at times. One star is deducted for the absence of an ebook or pdf version."

After developing the necessary probability theory, it presents the concepts of estimation, such as convergence, point estimators, confidence intervals, and hypothesis tests. The text then shifts from a general development of mathematical statistics to focus on applications particularly popular in economics.

		"Description": "This book allows those with a basic knowledge of econometrics to learn the main nonparametric and semiparametric techniques used in econometric modelling, and how to apply them correctly.  It looks at kernel density estimation, kernel regression, splines, wavelets, and mixture models, and provides useful empirical examples throughout. Using empirical application, several economic topics are addressed, including income distribution, wage equation, economic\n                            convergence, the Phillips curve, interest rate dynamics, returns volatility, and housing prices. A helpful appendix also explains how to implement the methods using R. \n\n                            This useful book will appeal to practitioners and researchers who need an accessible introduction to nonparametric and semiparametric econometrics. The practical approach provides an overview of the main techniques without including too much focus on mathematical formulas. It also serves as an accompanying textbook for a basic course, typically at undergraduate or graduate level.\n"

		"Description": "This titel offers tools to improve decision making in an imperfect world. This publication provides readers with a thorough understanding of Bayesian analysis that is grounded in the theory of inference and optimal decision making. \"Contemporary Bayesian Econometrics and Statistics\" provides readers with state-of-the-art simulation methods and models that are used to solve complex real-world problems. Armed with a strong foundation in both theory and practical problem-solving tools, readers discover how to optimize decision making when faced with problems that involve limited or imperfect data. The book begins by examining the theoretical and mathematical foundations of Bayesian statistics to help readers understand how and why it is used in problem solving. The author then describes how modern simulation methods make Bayesian approaches practical using widely available mathematical applications software.In addition, the author details how models can be applied to specific problems, including: linear models and policy choices; modeling with latent variables and missing data; time series models and prediction; and, comparison and evaluation of models.\n                            The publication has been developed and fine- tuned through a decade of classroom experience, and readers will find the author's approach very engaging and accessible. There are nearly 200 examples and exercises to help readers see how effective use of Bayesian statistics enables them to make optimal decisions.MATLAB and R computer programs are integrated throughout the book. An accompanying Web site provides readers with computer code for many examples and datasets. This publication is tailored for research professionals who use econometrics and similar statistical methods in their work. With its emphasis on practical problem solving and extensive use of examples and exercises, this is also an excellent textbook for graduate-level students in a broad range of fields, including economics, statistics, the social sciences, business, and public policy.\n"
