		"Description": "In this volume in his exceptional series of translations of Russian mathematical texts, Richard Silverman has taken Shilov's course in linear algebra and has made it even more accessible and more useful for English language readers.\n                            Georgi E. Shilov, Professor of Mathematics at the Moscow State University, covers determinants, linear spaces, systems of linear equations, linear functions of a vector argument, coordinate transformations, the canonical form of the matrix of a linear operator, bilinear and quadratic forms, Euclidean spaces, unitary spaces, quadratic forms in Euclidean and unitary spaces, finite-dimensional algebras and their representations, with an appendix on categories of finite-dimensional spaces.\n                            The author begins with elementary material and goes easily into the advanced areas, covering all the standard topics of an advanced undergraduate or beginning graduate course. The material is presented in a consistently clear style. Problems are included, with a full section of hints and answers in the back.\n                            Keeping in mind the unity of algebra, geometry and analysis in his approach, and writing practically for the student who needs to learn techniques, Professor Shilov has produced one of the best expositions on the subject. Because it contains an abundance of problems and examples, the book will be useful for self-study as well as for the classroom.\n"

		"Description": "David Poole's innovative LINEAR ALGEBRA: A MODERN INTRODUCTION, 4e emphasizes a vectors approach and better prepares students to make the transition from computational to theoretical mathematics. Balancing theory and applications, the book is written in a conversational style and combines a traditional presentation with a focus on student-centered learning. Theoretical, computational, and applied topics are presented in a flexible yet integrated way. Stressing geometric understanding before computational techniques, vectors and vector geometry are introduced early to help students visualize concepts and develop mathematical maturity for abstract thinking. Additionally, the book includes ample applications drawn from a variety of disciplines, which reinforce the fact that linear algebra is a valuable tool for modeling real-life problems.\n"

		"Description": "Linear algebra is a fundamental area of mathematics, and is arguably the most powerful mathematical tool ever developed. It is a core topic of study within fields as diverse as: business, economics, engineering, physics, computer science, ecology, sociology, demography and genetics. \n\n                            For an example of linear algebra at work, one needs to look no further than the Google search engine, which relies upon linear algebra to rank the results of a search with respect to relevance. \n\n                            The strength of the text is in the large number of examples and the step-by-step explanation of each topic as it is introduced. It is compiled in a way that allows distance learning, with explicit solutions to set problems freely available online. The miscellaneous exercises at the end of each chapter comprise questions from past exam papers from various universities, helping to reinforce the reader's confidence. Also included, generally at the beginning of sections, are short historical\n                            biographies of the leading players in the field of linear algebra to provide context for the topics covered. \n\n                            The dynamic and engaging style of the book includes frequent question and answer sections to test the reader's understanding of the methods introduced, rather than requiring rote learning. When first encountered, the subject can appear abstract and students will sometimes struggle to see its relevance; to counter this, the book also contains interviews with key people who use linear algebra in practice, in both professional and academic life. It will appeal to undergraduate students in\n                            mathematics, the physical sciences and engineering.\n"

		"Description": "This best-selling textbook for a second course in linear algebra is aimed at undergrad math majors and graduate students. The novel approach taken here banishes determinants to the end of the book. The text focuses on the central goal of linear algebra: understanding the structure of linear operators on finite-dimensional vector spaces. The author has taken unusual care to motivate concepts and to simplify proofs. A variety of interesting exercises in each chapter helps students understand and manipulate the objects of linear algebra.\n\n                            The third edition contains major improvements and revisions throughout the book. More than 300 new exercises have been added since the previous edition. Many new examples have been added to illustrate the key ideas of linear algebra. New topics covered in the book include product spaces, quotient spaces, and dual spaces. Beautiful new formatting creates pages with an unusually pleasant appearance in both print and electronic versions.\n\n                            No prerequisites are assumed other than the usual demand for suitable mathematical maturity. Thus the text starts by discussing vector spaces, linear independence, span, basis, and dimension. The book then deals with linear maps, eigenvalues, and eigenvectors. Inner-product spaces are introduced, leading to the finite-dimensional spectral theorem and its consequences. Generalized eigenvectors are then used to provide insight into the structure of a linear operator.\n"

		"Review": "Excellent textbook for a second look at linear algebra from a strictly theoretical standpoint. It size is small enough so that one may comfortably carry it around and promptly, effortlessly smack around fools that utter:  \"linear algebra! that's just y = mx + b!!! LOLZ\". Their education is the responsibility of us all, and how often we forget the old ways... The proofs are clear but do require the reader to fill in some gaps. This is intended. Open to any page and witness the clarity that so often escape the best efforts of a certain class of instructor; Axler will not suffer any unmotivated concepts. Everything builds from previous definitions until there's just enough structure to flesh out the chapter objectives, thus there's little fat distract the reader. Moreover, Axler is so badass that he does away with determinants until the last chapter of the book, he's so pimp he just didn't need any stinking determinants in his proofs. That's right, the last chapter introduces trace and determinants and proceeds to bring everything together into a magnificent mic drop: I now finally understand why determinants are inextricably tied to notions of volume, and why we must multiply by the Jacobian when performing change of variables in multi-variable integrals, and so on.A newcomer to linear algebra will get very little of use here, save for the clearest definitions I've ever seen regarding the structure of vector spaces, subspaces and linear operators. For a more applied/introductory approach to linear algebra, one can do much worse than Strang.I now feel much more comfortable moving onto a graduate-level Linear algebra course after visiting Axler's book, as such, it will be an invaluable reference moving forward.

		"Review": "[Second reading]I read this the second time at the beginning of my physics PhD. It was much more pleasant to read. I am a slow learner, so even if the subject is for beginning undergraduates, a few concepts only make sense to me now. I can also appreciate a little better the whole thing about generalized eigenvectors, nilpotency, Jordan form, and various decomposition (in particular singular value and polar decomposition). I am sure I will forget them soon, considering that I don't use them often in my research, but this probably means that I am not as blind as I was in the past, and I probably don't need to re-read the book for the third time from cover to back.Highly recommended linear algebra textbook, more so than the standard \"Friedberg\" one actually.---[First reading] Very good book for linear algebra, one which attempts to avoid the rather unmotivated concepts of determinants to prove many important results. The book focuses more on operators which are more abstract and more general than matrices themselves, providing easy proofs of theorems such as Cayley-Hamilton or that operators in complex vector space always has an eigenvalue.The first two chapters are easy to grasp and it forces us to understand linear independence and basis without explicitly using matrix concepts of basis vectors.Chapter 3 gives good motivation of matrix product, that matrix is a book-keeping device for linear mapping process. Full understanding of range-null formula and composition of maps enables us to easily get back the usual Rank-Nullity formula and matrix products. Chapter 4's short explanations on polynomials are rather enlightening for those who did not delve deeply into it - the factorization theorem is particularly illuminating.Chapter 5 is where the difficulty starts - the concept of invariant subspaces, projections of subspaces. However, the statements on how we can always find upper triangular matrices and diagonal matrices for some operators are useful. The proof that every operator in complex vector space has eigenvalue is extremely simple, compared to the use of determinant version.Chapter 6 is the usual standard teaching of inner product space. A useful concept taught would be how the concept can be used to compute better approximations of some functions within an interval than its own Taylor expansion. The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality proof is very intuitive and simple instead of using rather random construction. I found it difficult on digesting linear functionals, however.Chapter 7's usefulness should be well known to those who have done linear algebra - the spectral theorems. It gives clear decomposition of vector spaces into eigenspaces, allowing us to always find diagonal matrices for normal/hermitian operators depending on whether the vector space is complex or real. It also covers block diagonal matrices and isometry, and also polar and singular value decomposition quite clearly.Chapter 8 and 9 I find it difficult to follow, but the rough idea is indeed simple. Cayley-Hamilton theorem is easy to prove using tools developed in this book. Many results are generalized using generalized eigenvectors and block diagonal matrices. It covers Jordan form in the final section of chapter 8. Characteristic polynomials are well developed here, as well as why characteristic polynomials are basis-independent.Last chapter on trace and determinant is in my opinion one of the best chapters. The determinant is no longer felt as if it came out of nowhere, since even the origin of signed elementary products are shown clearly. One can follow why determinant can be defined that way, though quite a bit of preliminary work to be done (about 2 pages of A4 paper) before things flow smoothly. One can also see clearly the relation between traces and determinants with characteristic polynomials. Many basic properties of determinants are beautifully proven here without much explicit use of matrices.Overall, the book presents much cleaner proofs and explanations as compared to the usual introductory linear algebra which uses matrices mostly. While clean proofs do not imply easier proofs, but it clarifies and generalizes many concepts. This is especially useful for mathematics majors who are more into abstract thinking rather than computational procedures, though if well understood, the book can tell many results which provide computational advantages, such as under what conditions the matrices have many zeros. Many of these concepts give much clearer motivation than the usual matrix explanations. However, for those who only need linear algebra insofar as computation and Gaussian elimination is concerned, then perhaps this book is sort of overkill.I would recommend the book for those more into abstract thinking, or more theoretical students such as theoretical physics students or mathematics students."

Axler truly outdid himself with this one. The book definitely lives up to its title."

		"Review": "Beautiful. One of the books where the reading process doesn't feel like learning more material, but rather like individual components falling into one big picture of the world of (finite-dimensional) linear spaces. That being said, don't pick this up without also studying additional material. LADR is beautiful, but by no means comprehensive:1) It lacks a lot of material, either in the topics presented, or additional topics (I would love to see the author's treatment of bilinear forms)2) Nearly no material or exercises on computations. I don't consider this a weakness, it's not what this book is about and such material would clutter the otherwise clean and beautiful presentation.3) No matter how many times the author makes a remark of how superior this approach is, knowing both is what everyone should do. Another text leaning more on the determinant, computations, applications, operations with matrices and geometrical approach text would be a great complement to this book."

		"Review": "Oh man, this book is SO GOOD! SO. GOOD. I learned linear algebra from https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3..., but this book is SO MUCH better in terms of motivating any number of abstractions. I'm not sure if it's because of my having becoming more familiar with abstraction since having read that book or if it's actually this book, but I thought this was far more approachable, without being any less rigorous. It certainly went through all the same material, so all the material that I didn't understand the reasoning for (i.e. considering the dual space and annihilators in that space or the permutation formulation of determinants or generalized eigenspaces) made so much more sense in reading this book. There's also an ungodly number of exercises here, of which I probably did around 1/3. They had a good range of difficulty, in the space of completely elementary if you understood the material to requiring a decent bit of thought to piece together some of the concepts.Anyway, that was a long enough rant. But this book is GREAT"

As many others have noted, it largely avoids the use of matrices and determinants to focus on the purely algebraic aspects of the material.

I was able to read through almost the entire book in one long sitting since it was a lot of review for me was well-presented, and in the course of it I solidified some ideas and formed some new ones. My motivation for picking it up was to get a formal introduction to direct products and a few other scattered ideas that were not covered in my lin-alg course but it was so nice to read such clear expositions that I just kept reading."

		"Review": "I really liked this book, but I think there is some room for improvement. I will describe my reasoning below. Nevertheless, among the arid and dry landscape of mathematics, this book is an oasis.The premise of the book is simple and outrageous at first sight. Let us teach linear algebra without the use of determinants. \"Anathema!\" I hear you all shout. \"It is impossible\" (I heard myself think). However, Sheldon Axler proved me wrong. And honestly, it makes things much more intuitive and easy. But wait, isn't this like some sort of new math that would disable people to actually deal with determinants when encountering them elsewhere? Not at all. The very last chapter of the book is discussing determinants. This goes all the way after discussing finite dimensional vector spaces, linear maps, kernels, images, inner product spaces, the spectral theorem, the Cayley Hamilton theorem, and everything else you would expect in a typical undergraduate level math course.Each chapter is having plenty of exercises to give the student a relatively good grasp on the concepts. The book itself doesn't have the solutions, but they are available on a website. All this make this book a favorite of mine in regards to this subject. Nevertheless, it appears to me that there is some room for improvement. I do understand the need for proof for every theorem. The author has a point to make (i.e. that linear algebra can be taught in a more efficient way by delaying the study of the determinants). What I would have improved though is the intuitive aspect of this branch of mathematics.I believe that the books is a step in the right direction, and of course, I know that exercises help. However, I believe that due to the very abstract nature of this area of mathematics, some geometric approach of some kind, would have helped. When I first learned linear algebra, a lot of the concepts seem simply introduced as definitions, without a reasoning behind the why and how. As such, these courses were for me more of an exercise in memorization, and developed little practical understanding. I was not able to understand why people were coming up with the concepts and names of linear algebra.Mathematics is notorious for its abstractness and that is the main reason behind it. Consider the following (rather stupid) example that occurred to me when I first heard of the term \"linear transforms\" (linear mappings): A linear mapping is a kind of function. Of course, it has certain properties. For example, if we have a linear mapping \"f\" on a vector space, then f(a)+f(b) = f(a+b). Also, m*f(a) = f(m*a) . The question that occurred to me, was this: \"Why is a translation on a line not a linear transformation?\". Of course, the simple answer is this: \"It doesn't respect the properties above\". (A translation is a function like this T(x) = x + c where c is a constant)But really, a translation is simply moving something in a straight line, from point A to point B. It is the most obvious use of the word linear. Of course, there are explanations and since then I came to know better. Similar questions arise time and time again in the study of mathematics (why are eigenvalues so important? What about the adjoint of an operator? What is the idea behind them? What is the intuition behind the dual spaces? How come someone cared enough to name them? etc.)To me it seems that a lot of these issues can and should be explained better. I honestly don't believe these are stupid questions. Of course, I don't believe that simply giving a simplistic reasoning would increase your capacity of problem solving. However, this type of translation and understanding can certainly be done to great profit, and I believe it shortens the curve. Also, I do know that many of the questions do not have a satisfying answer. For example, I wasn't able to really understand why the mathematicians chose the term spectral for the spectral theorem. I do know when it was used first, and who used it, but apparently there is no clear understanding as to why he used it or whether he saw any connections to physics.I believe that Sheldon Axler's book is a huge step in the right direction, but I feel that further strides can be easily done, and I believe that there is enough room for improvement. At the moment at least, I think it is light years above my meager undergraduate course in explanatory power. I believe he could have added more examples taken from geometry and physics. "

		"Review": "Best book on Linear Algebra that I found from a whole bunch that were recommended to me. The author's determination to ignore determinants until the fag end of the textbook and just explaining concepts in more intuitive terms and not the rote, god-awful pedantic tradition of drawing up lines and boxes and putting numbers around them. It's extremely imaginative and makes an effort to get you to truly \"see\" linear spaces in a new light beyond all the greeks. If for some reason, you prefer the determinant-centric(?) approach and like more of a traditional approach to the subject, there's Gilbert Strang's legendary book too. But I have invited people to read this book and give linear algebra another shot (coz it's dope) and they have loved it just as much as I have. So this one's definitely my go-to comfort math book because it's just so much fun to read!P.S: This book is known to be extremely polarising among teachers, but I have so far only heard of the good experiences. Btw, there's also Linear Algebra Done Wrong by Sergei Treil that I think you should check out. Despite the name, another solid book."

		"Review": "It's a really good book overall... but it's biggest triumph--putting the determinant off until the end--is also its biggest downfall. Axler is right that linear algebra can be more elegantly developed without determinants than it is classically. This book is his proof that a coherent and clean theory can be developed according to his program.There are many areas where leaving out determinants leads to a more beautiful theory. But it isn't categorically true. For example, Axler was right that it is possible to develop the theory of eigenvalues/vectors without determinants. But the chapter on them feels like it's missing a good answer to computing eigenvalues. By far the most natural way, of course, is to take the determinant of A-lambda*I. It feels unnatural to talk about eigenvalues without mentioning this natural fact.Moreover, as a geometer, this book didn't entirely prepare me for what I needed to use linear algebra for. Most importantly, Axler was able to dance around using the determinant in linear algebra, but it occupies a much more unavoidable role in geometry, a fact owing ultimately to its place in tensor calculus.I've spent this review trying to justify giving only four stars to this book, because it really is excellent other than these problems."

That being said still a solid book (may go up to 4 stars if I do well on my final \ud83d\ude02). "

I was hooked after the author's proof of the Rank-Nullity theorem - the elegance of the proof was superb. The book also is the only book that gives a satisfactory theoretical explanation/justification of determinants. (Hint: It's not pretty that's why it's eschewed.)"

		"Review": "This is a great second book on linear algebra - something you might want to read once you read a foundation text on linear algebra first. It is a full color book which makes the book rather expensive. It's not a large book, but it's packed with just the right explanations and amount of theory to get you to understand the more mathematical aspects of linear algebra - the topics of spaces, linear maps and related theorems and concepts. The book is very accessible, has plenty of exercises (no solutions though!) and is quite well designed."

		"Review": "First of all, a big disclaimer,JUST DON'T READ THIS BOOK AS YOUR INTRODUCTION TO LINEAR ALGEBRA !!!I still can't find out why we were forced to have this book for our first course in linear algebra. This book is totally abstract, you have to prove things, there aren't many numerical problems or numerical stuff. So after finishing this book you'll probably end up with an Existential crisis if you want to enter machine learning by the time you've finished this book. Sheldon Axler wants to be different. Ok, that's fine but, why on earth I have to burden this attitude? He introduced determinants as the wrap-up for his book. why? cause he just wants to be different.He introduced SVD in some kinda weird and ugly way. why? cause he just wants to be different. literally not in the formal notation that you would saw in other books and real-life and you won't probably understand why this thing matters and instead of that you can have Jordan form (Such a blessing thanks god!!) Ah this book totally reminds me of the Babadook meme Sheldon Axler why can't you be normal :(It was a fun but abstract experience and clearly, don't recommend it if you're an application-based guy rather than proof-based. I feel I've wasted my time with something that I didn't mean to learn.Instead of this go with Gilbert Strang's books for god sake."

		"Review": "I had this book checked out of the library for nearly a year and kept renewing it because of how well it guides the reader through the theoretical topics. I have also watched every video that the author has posted on YouTube. This is the absolute best textbook I have read because it most significantly changed the way I think about not only math, but all technical topics in general.I have not finished all of the exercises, and it may take me a few more years to fully understand all of the content, but learning the concepts of Linear Algebra will save you time and energy in the long run. If you learn the concepts of vector spaces correctly and fully, then you won't be confused by mediocre explanations of vectors that you might get from a standard engineering textbook. The only downside is that by reading this book, you will expect more rigor from the next proofs you read, and that is a high bar to live up to.If you are new to higher level mathematics, it may take you all day to get through a few pages, especially since many new terms and notations are introduced. Also, the problems at the end of each chapter can be extremely difficult, but you can find worked-out solutions online since the book has become so popular among students lately. But all of the pieces are laid out, so you will know both why and how the solution is correct when you see it.There is a twist ending, where unlike other textbooks, (view spoiler)[determinants (hide spoiler)] don't show up until the last chapter."

		"Review": "Linear Algebra Done Right by Sheldon Axler is a testament to what a good mathematics textbook can be.First let me talk about the tone that is present throughout. I would definitely say this is an upper division undergraduate text, but the author goes above and beyond to be transparent with the reader so that they get the most out of the text. This includes historical background, alternative notation, being consistent with the chosen notation, and pointing out important parts of proofs and examples to dedicate special attention to. It's too bad that this style of writing is so rare in mathematics literature, and I thank Dr. Axler for adopting it here.As with the tone, the actual linear algebra material presented was skillfully arranged. I also thought the \"pure\" approach was more interesting than what you might find in an applied linear algebra text which focuses on computation and matrices more than the underlying theory.Overall a 5 star mathematics book, if not for the S tier quality then simply because I think more people should have exposure to advanced math lol."

You will not know what similar matrices are, even after you read upto the end of the index in this book. This term is not defined in the book. Another term with the same fate is \"nullity of a matrix\". The theorem \"rank of a matrix plus its nullity equals the number of rows\" is absent. Change of Basis Theorem is in the very last chapter (10) of the book. Is this a legitimate Linear Algebra textbook? And does the book title \"Linear Algebra Done Right\" imply all other Linear Algebra books do it wrong? That is insulting lot of good authors. What is going on here Springer Verlag? Was this text vetted at all?"

		"Review": "There should be a subtitle \"Thinking Like an Algebraist.\" This is linear algebra from a mathematics perspective, not physics or engineering or anything else. Even in math, it doesn't touch on analysis until the final chapter where he defines determinants.That said, the book is brilliant for its presentation. The order of topics, examples and results makes so many things just \"fall out.\" For example, the proof Cauchy-Hamilton is pretty much \"duh\" and that of Jordan Canonical form is dead simple.It's kinda like the first time you realize that trigonometry is really just the Pythagorean theorem, the unit circle, and some calculations."

		"Review": "The preface of this book states that it is \"meant as a complement to other, more comprehensive literature, not as a substitute.\" It would of course be wise of me to agree with this statement, but I'm tempted not to. I have my reasons.I took Linear Algebra in college as part of my Computer Science curriculum. Having persisted through three semesters of Calculus by will power alone, and having heard horror stories about Linear Algebra, I duly invested the effort required to get a decent grade. With that hurdle behind me, thus completing my mathematics requirements, I focused the rest of my college thoughts exclusively on computers until the last residual matrix reduced to null in the outer reaches of my mind space. I was free!But then the unexpected happened. Years later, firmly settled into my minimal-math computing career, an intermittent musing continued to flounder about in the back of my brain. \"What is Linear Algebra? Why don't I feel like I learned anything?\" I eventually realized that my course's extraordinary emphasis on crunching numbers, solving simplistic problems, and working out proofs had left a giant void in my conceptual understanding of the topic. If somebody had asked me at that time what Linear Algebra is and what it's good for, my response would have been a face slowly contorting into frustration.When I stumbled upon The Manga Guide to Linear Algebra, I just knew I had to read it. In addition to the unabated glee that came from broadcasting such a ridiculous selection to my Goodreads comrades, I thought, \"Maybe these Japanese cartoons can teach me what the university failed to?\" If I learned a little bit about martial arts and love in the process, so be it.This book exceeded my expectations. It's absurd and unassuming, and these two things combine to make it impossible to put down. I was knee deep in matrices before the \"What the heck am I reading?\" factor wore off. And to my delight, I found myself understanding matrix and vector algebra in a more intuitive way thanks to the book's highly visual presentation of darn near everything.It's this latter point that makes the book so effective. It's a comic book about math. There are no rules. Whatever is proper in a math textbook - whether it's visual consistency, formal language, or being rigidly organized, compartmentalized, and sterilized - this is of no concern to Misa as she works around Reiji's karate schedule to tutor him on eigenvectors. There's no pressure for it to conform to comic book conventions, either. Every chapter concludes with several pages of math, sans the comic flair.While this is not a substitute to \"comprehensive literature,\" it may in fact be good enough to get the job done. The proof is in the purin. I've recently ventured into the 3D video game programming landscape, and I'm using vector and matrix math concepts to solve some fairly sophisticated problems of my own creation, a feat that would have been virtually impossible without the intuitive understanding I gleaned from this book.So what is this book, then? To my mind, it's simply the most effective way to convey the conceptual framework of Linear Algebra. It's not a textbook. There are no homework problems. But, then again, cranking through problems with a pencil and paper won't necessarily get you any closer to understanding what it's all about. Besides, can't computers do that?"

		"Review": "After having read this book and finding it greatly enjoyable as well as informative, I think that the Manga guides to other subjects are likely to be of interest to me as well.\u00a0 By putting a layer between the admittedly somewhat dry and dull material of linear algebra and the reader, the book allows the reader to put themselves in the shoes of Misa, an appealing young woman who struggles with the subject and wants to know how practical it is and how to understand the material for her college math class.\u00a0 And looking at this book as an entrance into the series as a whole, it is worthwhile to add one layer between the reader and the raw material of mathematics (or science), given that the interest in the plot itself allows the material to be more interesting because of the context that it is in.\u00a0 It is only a wonder that this sort of approach has not been taken before because of its obvious appeal for those who are interested in both manga as well as math and science and who seek to leverage narrative and story to make mathematics and science easier to appreciateAt its core, this is a book that deals with three people with complex motivations.\u00a0 We have Reiji, a freshman at a university who is a bit of a weakling but devoted to getting stronger through the mastery of karate.\u00a0 We have Tetsuo, who is powerful at karate but (spoiler alert) not too bright when it comes to math, and we have Tetsuo's younger sister Misa, a beautiful freshman girl who Reiji tutors in mathematics thanks to a deal he makes with Tetsuo.\u00a0 The frame story of their interactions, and the growing attraction that Reiji and Misa feel for each other, as well as Reiji's attempts to prove himself to be strong takes place in the midst of instruction about linear algebra, where Reiji gives Misa (and the reader) various instruction on linear algebra in eight chapters, starting with an overview of linear algebra (1), moving on to the fundamentals of implication, equivalence, set theory, functions, combinations, and permutations (2), an introduction to matrices, matrix calculations, and special matrices (3), more matrices, including determinants and Cramer's rule (4), vectors and vector calculations (5), linear independence, bases, dimensions, and coordinates (6), linear transformations and matrix rank (7), and eigenvalues and eigenvectors (8).\u00a0 The instruction fits snugly with the story of karate and romance that surrounds it and makes for a compelling vehicle for mathematics instruction and its practicality.What does one get out of this particular book?\u00a0 It is a compelling mixture of technical material, which is deadly dull when one looks at it on its own, with a fascinating story and beautiful artwork.\u00a0 And that combination is one that would likely translate to a lot of other materials as well.\u00a0 This book, and the series it belongs to, is evidence of at least a few things, namely the importance of learning math and science and the difficulty many people in learning the material and sustaining interest in it unless it is packaged in the right way.\u00a0 Some people might be offended by this sort of thing, but as someone who finds it more worthwhile to learn and to encourage learning than to complain about the sort of form that the learning is bundled with, I don't see any reason to complain personally, except to wish that these had been around earlier.\u00a0 Still, the story itself demonstrates the relationship between math knowledge and other skills, and demonstrates how it is that nerdy people can leverage their willingness to work hard at difficult subjects beyond math and science alone, which is useful information even for those who know the material already."

		"Review": "I'm giving this 4 stars as reading it was as much entertaining as it was useful. I needed a quick review on the basics of Algebra and this sure did the trick. These manga guides are delightful to read; they have a guide to statistics and data basis which are, I'm sure, as interesting to have. The manga guide to Linear Algebra contains an overview of the fundamentals concerning set and number theory, functions, permutations and combinations. Then, of course, there is an introduction to matrices and vectors as well as various operations on these, linear transformations, and eigenvalues and eigenvectors. "

		"Review": "This in an entertaining run through of all of the main concepts of linear algebra. While it doesn't go through proofing any of the methods of properties, it gives you good intuition for them. The topics covers are on par or greater than a introductory college course in linear algebra. The only fault I found is that it rushes through matrix multiplication. This is a pretty critical thing to master early, and if the reader isn't familiar with how to multiply matrices, it will make the rest of the book difficult. I'd recommend this as a casual secondary book to students taking linear algebra who tend to have difficult with formal mathematics or to someone that haven't worked with linear algebra in a long time and need to refresh their knowledge.Note while, the translation from the original Japanese is excellent some of the math terminology used varied from what I've used to from multiple books/courses/universities. This shouldn't be a major problem, the different terms aren't such that they might be confused, but students should make sure they know what terms match up to what in their coursework (it should not be difficult).

		"Review": "Probably more like 3.5 stars, but rounding up because I can see what the creators were going for and I think it's a laudable idea. Trying to present complex topics in the context of a story is a good idea, but the two were less interwoven here and more just interleaved. I also think that the difficulty of this kind of material when approached without an instructor can quickly become a step function, and human explanation can be required to bridge some of the gaps as you move through the topics. I still learned a few things, but this book is probably more useful for someone concurrently taking an actual course in some of the same material."

		"Review": "I had a background in undergrad Linear Algebra from one of the Strang's book \"Introduction to Linear Algebra\" before reading this book. Even with that background, I haven't been able to make sense of it, even after watching the accompanying lectures.The basic problem is Strang loves to introduce an idea without explaining it, perhaps for motivation or to give readers the sneak peek to readers of the wonderful things that await them. In this book, however, he has taken it too far. It's just one idea after another without any explanation, why is the idea useful, and where is it coming from? In the end, I think the struggle to make sense of this book is not worth it."

		"Review": "I took a linear algebra class a few years ago, but I wanted to review the material (I didn't understand a lot when I took the class, and I'd forgotten some stuff since then). This book was absolutely fantastic!As the name implies, the author assumes that you don't know anything and that you need everything spelled out. In my mind, especially for abstract math, too much explanation is always better than too little. I really appreciated that the author not only showed every step, but also verbally explained everything that they did, line by line. The author also made sure to include lots of repetition and redundancy in both demonstration processes and explaining concepts, which really helped to reinforce the material and tie later chapters back to prior learning.In addition, I really liked that the book includes so many structural and visual cues to guide the reader. There is an extensive organizational hierarchy (Section, Chapter, sub-chapter, sub-sub-chapter), and each component has a title and introduction that clearly explain what you're supposed to get out of it. New vocabulary is italicized, there's a glossary and an index, and there are symbols to indicate really important things to remember. Each chapter can be more-or-less self-contained because it recapitulates the bare minimum of what you need to know, but the book also refers back to previous and later chapters if you want to go more in-depth. This provides a lot of liberty to the reader to wander around the book if they are drawn to some sections more than others. Something to note - this book is meant as a clear explanation and introduction, which means that is it somewhat lacking in theory and also has no practice problems or chances for self-assessment. If you want to practice, you're only option is to try the worked problems before you read the answer, and there are generally at most 2 or 3 problems per concept. I have a more advanced theoretical text and also a problem book to satisfy those needs. However, even though this book doesn't go as in-depth, it still provides a strong introduction for people who are new to the subject. I would recommend this book to anyone who is new or wants to review the basic concepts - I now feel like I have a much better understanding, and that now I'm ready to tackle the technical stuff."

		"Review": "A fantastic little book with some very slick proofs. Worth reading if only for the very eye-opening alternate proofs presented (or at least outlined) alongside the classical ones, such as a continuity argument to prove the Cayley-Hamilton theorem in the non-diagonalisable case, and Lagrange multipliers (of all things) to prove the existence of an eigenvector for a symmetric matrix. I'm surprised I've never thought about applying Bezout's Lemma (from number theory) to polynomials, and even more surprised to see the number of linear algebra results it can prove. The chapters flow well, though some parts feel a little rough on the edges; there are some changes in tone, and some minor typos - but they don't really detract from the text. From a modern standpoint, it was a little jarring to read Lang claiming that determinants were \"efficient\" - this might be the only place where one is lead astray by letting n be 2 or 3.Readers wanting more than a brief overview of modern applications (Lang treats homogeneous linear ODEs as a single example of primary decomposition, and recurrences aren't mentioned at all) will want to consult some more modern sources."

I wouldn't recommend this book for anyone seeing Linear Algebra for the first time, as the book doesn't emphasise the geometric intuitions behind the subject. However, it works well for students who have already seen Linear Algebra from a more intuitive standpoint and want to understand the subject more rigorously. The style is very problem focused, and you learn the material in the book from doing the problems, which increase in difficulty. Solving all the problems in sequence and reading all of the proofs enabled me to pick up the underlying themes behind many of the difficult problems, and this gave me a lot of confidence heading into the exams. This may not be an easy read (the material is dense), but it is well worth reading."

The answer may surprise you!\n                            If you are interested in learning the mathematical concepts linear algebra and matrix analysis, but also want to apply those concepts to data analyses on computers (e.g., statistics or signal processing), then this book is for you. You'll see all the math concepts implemented in MATLAB and in Python. \n\n                            Unique aspects of this book: \n                            - Clear and comprehensible explanations of concepts and theories in linear algebra.\n                            - Several distinct explanations of the same ideas, which is a proven technique for learning.\n                            - Visualization using graphs, which strengthens the geometric intuition of linear algebra.\n                            - Implementations in MATLAB and Python. Com'on, in the real world, you never solve math problems by hand! You need to know how to implement math in software!\n                            - Beginner to intermediate topics, including vectors, matrix multiplications, least-squares projections, eigendecomposition, and singular-value decomposition.\n                            - Strong focus on modern applications-oriented aspects of linear algebra and matrix analysis.\n                            - Intuitive visual explanations of diagonalization, eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and singular value decomposition.\n                            - Codes (MATLAB and Python) are provided to help you understand and apply linear algebra concepts on computers.\n                            - ALL CODE IS DOWNLOADABLE from https: //github.com/mikexcohen/LinAlgBook\n                            - A combination of hand-solved exercises and more advanced code challenges. Math is not a spectator sport!\n"

		"Description": "Differential equations and linear algebra are two central topics in the undergraduate mathematics curriculum. This innovative textbook allows the two subjects to be developed either separately or together, illuminating the connections between two fundamental topics, and giving increased flexibility to instructors. It can be used either as a semester-long course in differential equations, or as a one-year course in differential equations, linear algebra, and applications. Beginning with the basics of differential equations, it covers first and second order equations, graphical and numerical methods, and matrix equations. The book goes on to present the fundamentals of vector spaces, followed by eigenvalues and eigenvectors, positive definiteness, integral transform methods and applications to PDEs. The exposition illuminates the natural correspondence between solution methods for systems of equations in discrete and continuous settings. The topics draw on the physical sciences, engineering and economics, reflecting the author's distinguished career as an applied mathematician and expositor.\n"

		"Review": "Ah, what a beautiful picture.I love this book. The attraction comes, I think, partly from the beauty of the subject, but also partly from the clean way in which Strang packages all of his mathematical expositions. I spent many a nerdy weekend morning with this book and the OCW lectures.Which brings me to the second most important point that I'd like to get across in this review: you need to pair this book with MIT OpenCourseWare's Linear Algebra lectures (also, coincidentally, taught by the magnificent Strang). They're all freely available on the OCW site or on YouTube. These follow the book very closely and are indispensable\u2014Strang is an even better lecturer than he is a writer. (Some friends complain of a certain \"Strang-speak\" in his book: a certain awkwardness with words that sometimes obscures a point. I can understand these gripes, and this is why the lectures are really absolutely necessary until one has adjusted to the writing style.)The most important point, of course, is that I think you should read this book. Linear algebra (as portrayed by this book) is a really beautiful field\u2014much cleaner and often more intuitive than other areas at the same level (calculus, differential equations, etc.). It will activate a new part of your mind, and give you new ways to visualize problems in other domains [1]. This book reminded me of the value of math, when other textbooks and other classes sometimes failed to do so. Give this book a try\u2014it will change your mind!Footnotes:1. As a programmer, this book has opened up new opportunities for me. I can now talk fluently about the machinery behind least-squares problems, neural networks, etc., and I can now explore more advanced parts of machine learning, data mining, computational statistics, etc. etc. Absolutely worth it!"

		"Review": "Strang has a unique way to represent linear algebra, it is confusing at first but you if you start connecting with the book you would absolutely love it.

		"Review": "I read this in conjunction with MIT's OCW Scholar class and did all the problem sets and took the tests. Took me some time to finish the course, but it was surprising to find how fun linear algebra can be. I mean matrices and vectors? They weren't nearly sexy as curvy double integrals (multivariable calculus) or kinky Markov chains (probability theory). And I took the course only because linear algebra was indispensable for making a headway into mathematical statistics, probability theory, and other higher branches of math. But I have to admit, I kind of started liking this dowdy branch of math for its plain elegance. You have to admit, it's SO plain. Just look at the cover. Squares and rectangles? Are we in elementary geometry here? Euclid is, like, so played out. BUT there's some sexiness here if you look closely: Gaussian elimination, projections, eigenvalues and eigenvectors, diagonalization, and the crux of it all, single value decomposition (yes, I know, I'm shamelessly showing off a little here because I genuinely think these are cool-sounding and actually practical concepts). True to their reputation, Professor Strang's video lectures are golden\u2014there was one with a bad camera and another that was hard to follow, but that's like 2 out of 33 lectures. The rest were crystal clear and made the subject sound a bit too easy. The book, on the other hand, was less clear and less useful, as it keeps bringing up new concepts ahead of time and doesn't give motivating explanations for the material (I'm still a little iffy on why diagonalization is useful, how the \"particular\" solution is related to \"special\" solutions in solving Ax = b, or how single value decomposition can be applied, for example). The biggest problem with this book is, well, the problem sets. They are really not all that helpful. He should have at least included questions from other sections (for greater learning) and more basic questions just to let the students practice the mechanics of the concepts. They were also just...disappointingly easy. Compared to, say, Blitzstein's excellent but difficult probability theory online class, the questions were either trivially abstract or too basic to be of any challenge to contribute to solid learning experience. Overall, though, I would definitely recommend this textbook along with his lectures, but I'd complement it with a more rigorous textbook and/or online course (which I'm planning on doing with Sheldon Axler's Linear Algebra Done Right and Paul Halmos's Linear Algebra Problem Book). I did get a good grasp of the field (though far from mastery) and it was well worth the effort. "

		"Review": "I skimmed through the book for the review of linear algebra. I am not satisfied with the exposition - it's \"messy\". Author obviously tried to make the thematic as close as possible to the novices, but in the process he created a style that will not satisfy someone more adjusted to usual mathematical flow of exposition. Concept presentation is asking more for the intuition than precision and playing more on empirical pathway to explaining with, more often than not, concepts used before giving the definition. Anyways, this book might be of use to the newcomers to linear algebra and math in general as this style might be just what they are looking for. The book does a great job at introducing applications of linear algebra and there lies it's great value."

		"Review": "I read the \"South Asian\" edition of this book. I also used to watch Prof. Strang's lectures from https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathemati....The great thing about this book is Prof. Strang provides intuition into a very abstract topic. The way he did that is by using examples to illustrate the concepts. Some concepts in particular, for example linear subspaces and least squares, are beautifully explained.I think the greatest thing I got from this book is this example based thinking to increase my intuition into what would be very abstract topics. Now, whenever I have difficulty understanding some idea or a problem, I draw an example. Unfortunately, I think Prof. Strang went too far with this approach and it failed for Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors. There were two major problems. One, he changed the viewpoint of a matrix multiplication suddenly and without warning, from the combination of vectors to an application of an operator. Two, the theorems of eigenvalues and eigenvectors, which include some very important results for symmetric matrices, are proved in a very obscure way. I was relieved after I finished that section because it was just painful to go through it. The way I learned eigenvectors was to essentially reconstruct from the fragments in the book.Also, I feel that the book is not very clear by itself and is supposed to be used with lectures. Prof. Strang jumps right into the topic in nearly every section without any background or motivation.Overall, despite some shortcomings, I think this is a brilliant introduction to linear algebra. Whether your motivation is to apply linear algebra to some problem or to go into more abstract parts, this book is a great starting point."

If you've watched the lectures it's hard not to like this book but, objectively it appears that the information in the lectures has just been pointed at paper without regard to the fact that the ongoing narrative available in the lectures is missing from the print version.This leaves one having to piece things together oneself, not so much the linear algebra, but what one is supposed to be focusing on. That happened to many times for me so fired up Jeff Holts book.Ron Larson, Kuldeep Singh are also with a look for beginners.Strang's book is a good reference but lacks cohesion for beginners or those who haven't seen his excellent lecture style.Strang is a star, but his book needs an editor!"

The lectures give you the big picture, a good overview. This book then serves to reinforce your understanding of it. I only read the parts of the book relevant to my studies so that's still about 80%. My confidence and understanding of linear algebra is much better; the problem sets are really instructive and all solutions are given on the website. I started this book with the explicit goal of understanding Singular Value Decomposition from first principles, this was in order to augment my existing understanding of the statistical incarnation of SVD: the PCA. There are few resources I can think of that are better at reaching this goal in such a short amount of time. "

		"Review": "For me this book was quite hard to read, because it is often mathematically imprecise. Terms and concepts are used before they are fully introduced. Understanding sentences requires that you have already built up some amount of intuition that you don't usually have when reading an introductory text book.While other math books often build on mathematical rigor alone and neglect building up the reader's intuition, this book neglects rigor in favor of a more intuitive approach. For me this is really difficult to follow, because the exact meaning of sentences is often unclear.Ideally a book would have both rigor and intuition."

		"Description": "Linear algebra is the foundation of science and engineering. Knowledge of linear algebra is a prerequisite for studying statistics, machine learning, computer graphics, signal processing, chemistry, economics, quantum mechanics, and countless other applications. Indeed, linear algebra offers a powerful toolbox for modelling the real world.\n\n\n\n\n                            The No Bullshit Guide to Linear Algebra shows the connections between the computational techniques of linear algebra, their geometric interpretations, and the theoretical foundations. This university-level textbook contains lessons on linear algebra written in a style that is precise and concise. Each concept is illustrated through definitions, formulas, diagrams, explanations, and examples of real-world applications. Readers build their math superpowers by solving practice problems and learning to use the computer algebra system SymPy to speed up tedious matrix arithmetic tasks.\n\n\n\n\n                            \"The book explains the concepts in a way that gives a strong intuitive understanding.\" - Joe Nestor, student\n\n\n\n\n                            \"It's very well written and a fun read!\" - Felix Kwok, professor\n\n\n\n\n                            \"I used this book in multiple big data courses when I needed a deeper understanding of the material.\" - Zane Zakraisek, student\n\n\n\n\n                            The author, Ivan Savov, combines 17 years of tutoring experience with a B.Eng. in electrical engineering, an M.Sc. in physics, and a Ph.D. in computer science from McGill University.\n"

I have to say that there are a few times I almost wanna give up, then the author will say a few encouraging words at those moments: \u201cyou could understand it with what you just learned. \u201c I am glad that I trusted the author, and I learned a great deal. Sometimes, the biggest barrier is not intellectuals but emotions. I really like the geometric algebra chapter, the intuition is amazing. Change of basis is another difficult topic to understand, the author did a fairly good job. The SVD chapters are mind-blowing. Chapter 3-5, I read quite a few times to fully get it. Many application of linear algebra are not relevant to my research, but I was able to follow and learned something new and interesting, such as the cryptography, Bayesian networks. For serious learners, I would recommend pairing this book with additional exercises (or coding questions) or books. This book has some exercises, but they are not enough to fully check your comprehension."

		"Review": "Best introductory text on this subject. Exposition is very clear, accompanied by lots of examples. The book doesn't jump straight into matrices like that of Strang, but, instead, starts with abstract vector spaces. This allows for a more categorical approach. Indeed, product, quotient, and dual spaces are introduced early on. Along the same line, linear maps are introduce before subjecting them to specific ordered bases to obtain matrices. There are dedicated sections that deals with fundamental issues, e.g., the existence of bases in the infinite dimensional case via the axiom of choice. Courageous are the authors to include abstract examples such as the inner product of two integrable functions over the reals by means of the integral of their product. These examples proves useful for further studies. However, the publisher excluded the essential chapter on Jordan forms from the international edition. This sort of malpractice is infuriating!"

The text aims to expand the reader's view of the field and to present standard material in a novel way. All of the most important topics in the field are covered with a fresh perspective, including iterative methods for systems of equations and eigenvalue problems and the underlying principles of conditioning and stability. Presentation is in the form of 40 lectures, which each focus on one or two central ideas. The unity between topics is emphasized throughout, with no risk of getting lost in details and technicalities. The book breaks with tradition by beginning with the QR factorization - an important and fresh idea for students, and the thread that connects most of the algorithms of numerical linear algebra.\n"

		"Review": "TL;DR: It is very good, simple and straight proofs, doesn't go deep on algorithms and edge cases for solving practical systems of equations and other problems.Arguments are almost all proved using the most elementary form, thus more simple to understand but it didn't prevent the writers to keep the work concise.In contrast with numerical linear algebra part of Numerical Linear Algebra And Optimization, This book has more theoretical depth, yet it lacks the vast examination of algorithms, for example for solving different types of linear systems of equations Gill et al. provided in-depth explanation of edge cases and different sizes of matrices with different ranks and a separate explanation for the full rank cases, but Trefethen et al. just assumed rows is going to be more than columns and ignored other cases, again this is the case for least squares problems. But this book has a detailed examination of the condition number of least squares problem while Gill et al.'s book just skimmed over it. This book has a big section about iterative methods and another one dedicated to the eigenvalue problem, which is great."

		"Review": "This is a great introduction to numerical linear algebra, and would even be a decent text to cherry pick from, for those not interested in the numerical side specifically. The presentation assumes some familiarity with basic linear algebra concepts, like matrix operations and decompositions, and it would be best to start this text already being comfortable with matrix manipulations, column/row operations, etc. The presentation generally gives a chapter on theory before discussing the numerical algorithm. For example, QR factorization and eigenvalue decomposition are discussed from a purely mathematical perspective before discussing Gram-Schmidt and the QR algorithm.Some topics that would be nice to see are left out (e.g., Givens rotations, which only appear as a problem), but overall this gives a broad overview of numerical linear algebra that is complete enough for most engineers and scientists. The algorithms provided are all serial, leaving parallel algorithms for another course. If taking a class where Golub's text is the only required text, I highly recommend using this as a supplement."

Aka. \"how to make computers do that annoying stuff with matrices, because you will pretty much always forget a negative sign if you do it yourself, and will go insane if you attempt a problem greater than 5x5\". This book starts off strong, and gives good coverage of the basics; forward and backward stability, LU decomposition, QR factorization, etc. However, it seems like it becomes more vague as the topics become more complex-- eigen value methods in particular could have been covered in more detail. Its not too expensive though, and might be worth picking up if you need a basic introduction to numerical linear algebra. It does contain a brief review of some linear algebra topics, but I'd recommend you be familiar with them before attempting this book."

		"Description": "The approach is developmental. Although it covers the requisite material by proving things, it does not assume that students are already able at abstract work. Instead, it proceeds with a great deal of motivation, many computational examples, and exercises that range from routine verifications to (a few) challenges. The goal is, in the context of developing the usual material of an undergraduate linear algebra course, to help raise each student's level of mathematical maturity.\n"

		"Review": "I am editing my review from some years ago. Per standard curriculum, Linear Algebra is the bridge where students start learning the notion of abstraction rather than mechanical computations. After using this book to teach Linear Algebra, I'd say this one and Linear Algebra done right should be enough for your undergraduate Linear Algebra. Contentwise, the book only covers up to discovering the canonical form of similarity classes of matrices (namely Jordan Form) by breaking down the vector spaces into generalized null spaces. The pro and con about the book is that it deploys developmental approach so starting from an arbitrary chapter might not be a good idea but at the same time, it motivates why we are studying the order given in the text so students won't get lost during transitions of chapters."

		"Review": "In the typically awful genre of math textbooks, this one is pretty good. It's fairly readable, I was able to learn most topics straight from the book, and it separates out the material well, with the core text focused on the essentials and with supplementary sections that covered all of the ancillary relevant topics that I wanted to learn more about (e.g. Markov chains). It made it easy to page right through less core topics that were of less personal interest (but, another reader would find some of those useful while finding some that I found useful extraneous). It has plenty of examples and some good sample problems (seventy-five percent of the solutions are written out in a way that made perfect sense to me... 25% not so much, but that's a well above-average breakdown).The book comes with the added bonus of being available in print for a low cost and in e-form, with all of the supplementary materials, for free.I can only compare it to one other Linear Algebra textbook, which it easily surpasses, but can compare it to more math texts in general (both comparing as a learner, as I was in my use of this book, and as an instructor) and it seems solidly above average in the broader math text category."

		"Description": "Basic Linear Algebra is a text for first year students leading from concrete examples to abstract theorems, via tutorial-type exercises. More exercises (of the kind a student may expect in examination papers) are grouped at the end of each section. The book covers the most important basics of any first course on linear algebra, explaining the algebra of matrices with applications to analytic geometry, systems of linear equations, difference equations and complex numbers. Linear equations are treated via Hermite normal forms which provides a successful and concrete explanation of the notion of linear independence. Another important highlight is the connection between linear mappings and matrices leading to the change of basis theorem which opens the door to the notion of similarity. This new and revised edition features additional exercises and coverage of Cramer's rule (omitted from the first edition). However, it is the new, extra chapter on computer assistance that will be of particular interest to readers: this will take the form of a tutorial on the use of the \"LinearAlgebra\" package in MAPLE 7 and will deal with all the aspects of linear algebra developed within the book.\n"

		"Description": "Linear algebra is one of the central disciplines in mathematics. A student of pure mathematics must know linear algebra if he is to continue with modern algebra or functional analysis. Much of the mathematics now taught to engineers and physicists requires it.\n                            This well-known and highly regarded text makes the subject accessible to undergraduates with little mathematical experience. Written mainly for students in physics, engineering, economics, and other fields outside mathematics, the book gives the theory of matrices and applications to systems of linear equations, as well as many related topics such as determinants, eigenvalues, and differential equations.\n                            Table of Contents: \n                            l.

		"Review": "I enjoy the style and narrative in I.M. Gel'fand's \"Lectures on Linear Algebra.\" The book is from 1948 Russia. You are taken through n-dimensional spaces and into understanding linear transformations (in their canonical form). The final chapters cover dual spaces and tensors.With L.A., there are different approaches to aid in understanding. 1. A vector-space-granularity driven approach (useful for engineers, but can be grating after a bit) 2. A more theory-based sort of esoteric approach (seems preferable and ideal, but it is difficult to articulate complex concepts with elegance into hard terms with exactitude). Gel'fand's book is a great balance of both approaches. He gives you everything you might want in his explanations. He goes into some trippy areas with his chapter on complex n-dimensional spaces. If given the choice to only take one Linear Algebra book with me to a tropical island, I may choose this one. There's a lot to consider here.While other Dover Math books can be hit or miss, in that some are too simple or incomplete, this book is thorough and fulfilling in what it covers. Great for a rainy day. I comfortably sailed through about half of this one."

		"Review": "I sat down and read this in a day. I don't understand it yet. I don't have much intuition about what Gelfand speaks of. What I am sure of is that Gelfand saw algebra as a tool for combinatorics and analysis. Many people will see the index notation, as opposed to the matrix notation often used today, and be scared away but there's value in this approach. Especially if you're looking to use algebra for applied work. In fact I'm quite sure at how spartan this text is (under 200 pages) that it is really a tool to get as quickly as possible to combinatorialization.What this text talks about that I haven't seen much treatment to is bilinear form and intuition one gains on triangularization for combinatorics (he doesn't directly talk about this but it seems implied). As an undergraduate I haven't been able to find a good introduction to tensors until I ran across this book and again, I don't quite understand it yet but the treatment feels right."

A unique pedagogical feature is the starred section at the end of each chapter. Although these sections are not essential to the sequence of the book, they are related to the basic material and offer advanced topics to stimulate the more ambitious student. These topics include power series; existence and uniqueness theorems; Hilbert spaces; Jordan forms; Green's functions; Bernstein polynomials; and the Weierstrass approximation theorem. \n                            This carefully structured textbook provides an ideal, step-by-step transition from first-year calculus to multivariable calculus and, at the same time, enables the instructor to offer special challenges to students ready for more advanced material.\n"

		"Description": "This textbook introduces linear algebra and optimization in the context of machine learning. Examples and exercises are provided throughout the book. A solution manual for the exercises at the end of each chapter is available to teaching instructors. This textbook targets graduate level students and professors in computer science, mathematics and data science. Advanced undergraduate students can also use this textbook. The chapters for this textbook are organized as follows:\n\n                            1. Linear algebra and its applications: The chapters focus on the basics of linear algebra together with their common applications to singular value decomposition, matrix factorization, similarity matrices (kernel methods), and graph analysis. Numerous machine learning applications have been used as examples, such as spectral clustering, kernel-based classification, and outlier detection. The tight integration of linear algebra methods with examples from machine learning differentiates this book from generic volumes on linear algebra. The focus is clearly on the most relevant aspects of linear algebra for machine learning and to teach readers how to apply these concepts.\n\n\n                            2. Optimization and its applications: Much of machine learning is posed as an optimization problem in which we try to maximize the accuracy of regression and classification models. The \"parent problem\" of optimization-centric machine learning is least-squares regression. Interestingly, this problem arises in both linear algebra and optimization, and is one of the key connecting problems of the two fields.  Least-squares regression is also the starting point for support vector machines, logistic regression, and recommender systems. Furthermore, the methods for dimensionality reduction and matrix factorization also require the development of optimization methods. A general view of optimization in computational graphs is discussed together with its applications to back propagation in neural networks. \n\n\n                            A frequent challenge faced by beginners in machine learning is the extensive background required in linear algebra and optimization. One problem is that the existing linear algebra and optimization courses are not specific to machine learning; therefore, one would typically have to complete more course material than is necessary to pick up machine learning. Furthermore, certain types of ideas and tricks from optimization and linear algebra recur more frequently in machine learning than other application-centric settings. Therefore, there is significant value in developing a view of linear algebra and optimization that is better suited to the specific perspective of machine learning.\n"

		"Description": "This self-contained textbook takes a matrix-oriented approach to linear algebra and presents a complete theory, including all details and proofs, culminating in the Jordan canonical form and its proof. Throughout the development, the applicability of the results is highlighted. Additionally, the book presents special topics from applied linear algebra including matrix functions, the singular value decomposition, the Kronecker product and linear matrix equations.\n                            The matrix-oriented approach to linear algebra leads to a better intuition and a deeper understanding of the abstract concepts, and therefore simplifies their use in real world applications. Some of these applications are presented in detailed examples. In several 'MATLAB-Minutes' students can comprehend the concepts and results using computational experiments. Necessary basics for the use of MATLAB are presented in a short introduction. Students can also actively work with the material and practice their mathematical skills in more than 300 exercises.\n"

		"Review": "Best introductory text on this subject. Exposition is very clear, accompanied by lots of examples. The book doesn't jump straight into matrices like that of Strang, but, instead, starts with abstract vector spaces. This allows for a more categorical approach. Indeed, product, quotient, and dual spaces are introduced early on. Along the same line, linear maps are introduce before subjecting them to specific ordered bases to obtain matrices. There are dedicated sections that deals with fundamental issues, e.g., the existence of bases in the infinite dimensional case via the axiom of choice. Courageous are the authors to include abstract examples such as the inner product of two integrable functions over the reals by means of the integral of their product. These examples proves useful for further studies. However, the publisher excluded the essential chapter on Jordan forms from the international edition. This sort of malpractice is infuriating!"

		"Review": "I work with a few linear algebra types, so I decided a refresher was in order. Many years ago in college, the course I took worked up through idea of the Gram-Schmidt orthonomalizing process. This means I paid some of my dues, but stopping just shy of where the useful concepts start to kick in (processing data in a smaller/sparse basis, PCA, etc.). I selected this book because of its use of Python, and slowly worked through the content (however, I didn't code up the exercises). The FFT explanation is quite good. It was nice to see the author clearly state that determinants are good for making mathematical arguments, but are rarely useful in computation. That seems consistent with much in linear algebra, as it's not uncommon for me to be reading an algorithm paper that leads with a linear algebra explanation, but then goes on to say that it could never be computed using such an approach, and falls back on something more practical."

		"Description": "As the basis of equations (and therefore problem-solving), linear algebra is the most widely taught sub-division of pure mathematics. Dr Allenby has used his experience of teaching linear algebra to write a lively book on the subject that includes historical information about the founders of the subject as well as giving a basic introduction to the mathematics undergraduate. The whole text has been written in a connected way with ideas introduced as they occur naturally. As with the other books in the series, there are many worked examples.\n"

		"Description": "Most of the introductory courses on linear algebra develop the basic theory of finite  dimensional vector spaces, and in so doing relate the notion of a linear mapping to that of a matrix. Generally speaking, such courses culminate in the diagonalisation of certain matrices and the application of this process to various situations. Such is the case, for example, in our previous SUMS volume Basic Linear Algebra. The present text is a continuation of that volume, and has the objective of introducing the reader to more advanced properties of vector spaces and linear mappings, and consequently of matrices. For readers who are not familiar with the contents of Basic Linear Algebra we provide an introductory chapter that consists of a compact summary of the prerequisites for the present volume. In order to consolidate the student's understanding we have included a large num  ber of illustrative and worked examples, as well as many exercises that are strategi  cally placed throughout the text. Solutions to the exercises are also provided. Many applications of linear algebra require careful, and at times rather tedious, calculations by hand. Very often these are subject to error, so the assistance of a com  puter is welcome. As far as computation in algebra is concerned, there are several packages available. Here we include, in the spirit of a tutorial, a chapter that gives 1 a brief introduction to the use of MAPLE in dealing with numerical and algebraic problems in linear algebra.\n"

		"Review": "Goes well beyond an \"outline\" of elementary linear algebra, especially when compared to the course textbook I was assigned (Elementary Linear Algebra with Applications). Schaum's Outline provided all the same relevant theorems and proofs in rigorous mathematical language while taking time to define common mathematical notation for non-initiates. There are plenty of exercises at various stages of difficulty and application with thorough explanations for most solutions and step-by-step guides for some of the initial problems. There were very few typos or errors that I noticed and the narrative progression of concepts is well-chosen and explained. This \"outline\" is pretty much all you need to get through an elementary linear algebra course. "

		"Review": "I used this book for a proof based course on Linear and Abstract Algebra. I wouldn't recommend this book for anyone seeing Linear Algebra for the first time, as the book doesn't emphasise the geometric intuitions behind the subject. However, it works well for students who have already seen Linear Algebra from a more intuitive standpoint and want to understand the subject more rigorously. The style is very problem focused, and you learn the material in the book from doing the problems, which increase in difficulty. Solving all the problems in sequence and reading all of the proofs enabled me to pick up the underlying themes behind many of the difficult problems, and this gave me a lot of confidence heading into the exams. This may not be an easy read (the material is dense), but it is well worth reading."

		"Description": "This textbook on linear algebra includes the key topics of the subject that most advanced undergraduates need to learn before entering graduate school. All the usual topics, such as complex vector spaces, complex inner products, the Spectral theorem for normal operators, dual spaces, the minimal polynomial, the Jordan canonical form, and the rational canonical form, are covered, along with a chapter on determinants at the end of the book. In addition, there is material throughout the text on linear differential equations and how it integrates with all of the important concepts in linear algebra.\n\n                            This book has several distinguishing features that set it apart from other linear algebra texts.  For example: Gaussian elimination is used as the key tool in getting at eigenvalues; it takes an essentially determinant-free approach to linear algebra; and systems of linear differential equations are used as frequent motivation for the reader.  Another motivating aspect of the book is the excellent and engaging exercises that abound in this text. \n\n                            This textbook is written for an upper-division undergraduate course on Linear Algebra.  The prerequisites for this book are a familiarity with basic matrix algebra and elementary calculus, although any student who is willing to think abstractly should not have too much difficulty in understanding this text.\n"

One thing these essays have in common is the way that they express both the importance and the beauty of the subject, as well as the author's passion for mathematics. This text will be of practical use to students and researchers across a whole spectrum of numerate disciplines. Furthermore, this collection provides a unique perspective on mathematics and the communication thereof as a human endeavour, complemented as these essays are by commentary from the author regarding their provenance and the reaction to them\n"
